### [1] [GEM: Empowering LLM for both Embedding Generation and Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04344)
*Caojin Zhang,Qiang Zhang,Ke Li,Sai Vidyaranya Nuthalapati,Benyu Zhang,Jason Liu,Serena Li,Lizhu Zhang,Xiangjun Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法，可以使大型解码器-only语言模型在保持原有文本生成和推理能力的同时，生成高质量的文本嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用程序仍然依赖于单独的嵌入模型来生成文本嵌入，这可能会使系统复杂化，并在查询的理解上引入不一致。

Method: 提出了一种简单的自监督方法Generative Embedding large language Model（GEM），它通过在文本主体中插入新的特殊标记，并通过操作注意力掩码来生成文本的摘要嵌入。

Result: 该方法显著提高了原始LLMs在MTEB上的表现，同时对MMLU的影响最小。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以使LLMs具备最先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持其原有的自然语言处理性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

### [2] [Effects of Speaker Count, Duration, and Accent Diversity on Zero-Shot Accent Robustness in Low-Resource ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04364)
*Zheng-Xin Yong,Vineel Pratap,Michael Auli,Jean Maillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Build an automatic speech recognition system robust to many accents by optimizing training data composition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create an ASR system serving everyone worldwide, handling various accents.

Method: Systematically study how different training data variables impact ASR robustness.

Result: More speakers are better than more hours per speaker; more speakers enable performance gains from scaling hours.

Conclusion: Practitioners should prioritize increasing speaker count in ASR training data for new languages.

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

### [3] [Mechanistic Decomposition of Sentence Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04373)
*Matthieu Tehenan,Vikram Natarajan,Jonathan Michala,Milton Lin,Juri Opitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to make sentence embeddings more interpretable by decomposing them into interpretable components using dictionary learning on token-level representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal structure of sentence embeddings which are not human-interpretable due to complex neural transformations and pooling operations.

Method: Using dictionary learning on token-level representations to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components.

Result: The method allows for more transparent and controllable representations, and reveals insights such as semantic and syntactic aspects being linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Conclusion: This work bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, providing a better understanding of sentence embedding spaces.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

### [4] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Contrastive Learning Informed Path Guided Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04381)
*Neeraj Agrawal,Saurabh Kumar,Priyanka Bhatt,Tanishka Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes HTC-CLIP, a new method combining two existing approaches for hierarchical text classification using contrastive learning, achieving improved performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle complex label hierarchy in real-world applications such as E-commerce, customer care, and medicine industry.

Method: Combines label hierarchy encoding and text encoding using contrastive learning to learn hierarchy-aware text representation and text informed path guided hierarchy representation.

Result: Improves performance by 0.99-2.37% in Macro F1 score over existing state-of-the-art models on two public benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HTC-CLIP model effectively combines two previous approaches into one architecture for better hierarchical text classification.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

### [5] [MELABenchv1: Benchmarking Large Language Models against Smaller Fine-Tuned Models for Low-Resource Maltese NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04385)
*Kurt Micallef,Claudia Borg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available large language models on Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering 11 tasks. Investigate factors affecting model performance and trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of large language models on low-resource languages like Maltese and identify the most impactful factors on model performance.

Method: Evaluate 55 publicly available LLMs on Maltese using a newly introduced benchmark with 11 tasks; multidimensional analysis of factors impacting performance; compare fine-tuning and prompting approaches.

Result: Many models perform poorly, especially on generative tasks; smaller fine-tuned models often perform better; prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and instruction-tuning is the most important factor; fine-tuning has better performance and lower inference costs but requires higher initial cost.

Conclusion: Highlight the need for more inclusive language technologies and suggest that researchers working with low-resource languages consider traditional language modelling approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

### [6] [Building a Few-Shot Cross-Domain Multilingual NLU Model for Customer Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04389)
*Saurabh Kumar,Sourav Bansal,Neeraj Agrawal,Priyanka Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel embedder-cum-classifier model architecture that extends state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few labeled samples. The approach improves accuracy by 20-23% on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building an intent classifier that generalizes across domains (channel, geography, and language) with only a few annotations is of great practical value.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic regularizers and multilingual knowledge distillation strategy.

Result: Experiments on Canada and Mexico e-commerce Customer Care dataset show an increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.

Conclusion: The proposed model architecture effectively generalizes across domains with limited annotated data.

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Abstract: We introduce MedAgentGYM, the first publicly available training environment
designed to enhance coding-based medical reasoning capabilities in large
language model (LLM) agents. MedAgentGYM comprises 72,413 task instances across
129 categories derived from authentic real-world biomedical scenarios. Tasks
are encapsulated within executable coding environments, each featuring detailed
task descriptions, interactive feedback mechanisms, verifiable ground-truth
annotations, and scalable training trajectory generation. Extensive
benchmarking of over 30 LLMs reveals a notable performance disparity between
commercial API-based models and open-source counterparts. Leveraging
MedAgentGYM, Med-Copilot-7B achieves substantial performance gains through
supervised fine-tuning (+36.44%) and continued reinforcement learning
(+42.47%), emerging as an affordable and privacy-preserving alternative
competitive with gpt-4o. By offering both a comprehensive benchmark and
accessible, expandable training resources within unified execution
environments, MedAgentGYM delivers an integrated platform to develop LLM-based
coding assistants for advanced biomedical research and practice.

### [8] [Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04408)
*Wesley Scivetti,Tatsuya Aoyama,Ethan Wilcox,Nathan Schneider*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，虽然人类规模的语言模型能够识别罕见语法规则的形式，但在理解其意义方面表现不佳，揭示了现有模型架构的一个局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究了语言模型在罕见语法规则上的泛化能力，特别是形式和意义两方面。

Method: 测试人类规模的变压器语言模型对英语LET-ALONE结构的形式和意义的知识。

Result: 人类规模的语言模型对形式敏感，但在关于LET-ALONE意义的正确泛化上失败了。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义之间的样本效率存在不对称性，这在人类语言学习者中不存在。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

### [10] [Zero-Shot Open-Schema Entity Structure Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04458)
*Xueqiang Xu,Jinfeng Xiao,James Barry,Mohab Elkaref,Jiaru Zou,Pengcheng Jiang,Yunyi Zhang,Max Giammona,Geeth de Mel,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduce ZOES, a new approach for entity structure extraction that improves LLMs' ability to extract complete entity structures without using any schema or annotated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods based on LLMs typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute schemas or annotated datasets, leading to incomplete extraction results.

Method: A principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification.

Result: ZOES enhances LLMs' ability to extract more complete entity structures across three different domains.

Conclusion: ZOES improves the ability of LLMs to extract more complete entity structures without requiring any schema or annotated samples.

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

### [11] [Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462)
*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper systematically analyzes the impact of two popular watermarking approaches on the core alignment properties of four aligned large language models. It identifies two degradation patterns and proposes a method called Alignment Resampling to recover alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the effects of watermarking on the truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness of large language models.

Method: Systematic analysis of two watermarking approaches - Gumbel and KGW - on four aligned LLMs.

Result: Identified two degradation patterns: guard attenuation and guard amplification. Proposed Alignment Resampling method to recover alignment.

Conclusion: The balance between watermark strength and model alignment is crucial. The proposed inference-time solution can help responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs.

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

*Zhaoxuan Tan,Zheng Li,Tianyi Liu,Haodong Wang,Hyokun Yun,Ming Zeng,Pei Chen,Zhihan Zhang,Yifan Gao,Ruijie Wang,Priyanka Nigam,Bing Yin,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC利用用户生成内容(UGC)中的隐式偏好来生成对大语言模型的偏好数据，这种方法提高了偏好数据的质量并实现了可扩展的领域特定对齐。实验结果显示，与传统方法相比，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型性能提升了9.37%，并在Alpaca Eval 2上达到了35.93%的最先进的长度控制胜率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖于人类或高级大语言模型提供的精心策划的数据，这既昂贵又难以扩展。本研究旨在解决这一问题，通过利用用户生成内容中的隐式偏好来生成更高质量且更具可扩展性的偏好数据。

Method: PUGC框架将用户生成内容转化为用户查询，并从策略模型生成响应。然后利用这些用户生成的内容作为参考文本来评分响应，从而让模型与这些隐式偏好保持一致。

Result: 在Alpaca Eval 2上的实验表明，使用DPO和PUGC训练的模型比传统方法表现更好，性能提升了9.37%，同时在Mistral-7B-Instruct上实现了35.93%的最优长度控制胜率。此外，还观察到了奖励质量、领域特定对齐效果、对UGC质量的鲁棒性以及心智理论能力的提升。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种新颖的方法来生成偏好数据，它能够提高大语言模型与人类价值观的一致性，并改善生成响应的质量。这项工作展示了PUGC在提升模型性能和对齐效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens is an end-to-end framework for detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, improving error detection by 25.78% and execution accuracy by up to 20% compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the reliability of text-to-SQL systems by addressing semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries.

Method: Propose SQLens, which integrates error signals from the database and LLM to identify and correct potential semantic errors in SQL clauses.

Result: SQLens outperforms the best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection and improves execution accuracy of text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Conclusion: SQLens demonstrates significant improvements in detecting and correcting semantic errors in LLM-generated SQL queries, enhancing the reliability of text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

### [14] [DRE: An Effective Dual-Refined Method for Integrating Small and Large Language Models in Open-Domain Dialogue Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04516)
*Kun Zhao,Bohao Yang,Chen Tang,Siyuan Dai,Haoteng Tang,Chenghua Lin,Liang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method called SLIDE and a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) to combine small and large language models, showing better performance than existing methods in ambiguous scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous scenarios, while Small Language Models (SLMs) are robust in such scenarios but vulnerable to misleading or adversarial inputs. The goal is to leverage their complementary strengths.

Method: Introducing SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting, and proposing a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM integration.

Result: Experiments show that DRE outperforms existing methods, aligning strongly with human judgment across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work shows that combining small and large language models can create more reliable evaluation tools, especially for open-ended tasks like dialogue evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究发现显式分解翻译过程对性能提升无明显帮助，“再翻译”提示更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在许多任务上表现出强大的推理能力，通常通过链式思考（CoT）推理显式分解任务。最近关于基于LLM的翻译工作设计了手工制作的提示来分解翻译，或者训练模型包含中间步骤。然而，本研究旨在仔细审视这种策略的有效性。

Method: 实验方法主要是通过对比不同提示策略的效果，包括多步分解与精炼的提示和简单的“再翻译”提示，来检验显式分解翻译过程的有效性。

Result: 实验结果发现，至少对于测试中的模型，没有明确证据表明性能提升来自显式分解翻译过程；而简单的“再翻译”提示比类似人类的逐步提示表现得更好。

Conclusion: 分析表明，显式分解翻译过程并没有带来明确的性能提升，简单地让大语言模型“再翻译”反而效果更好。研究并未否定推理的作用，而是呼吁未来探索CoT在翻译背景下有效性的因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

*William Sheffield,Kanishka Misra,Valentina Pyatkin,Ashwini Deo,Kyle Mahowald,Junyi Jessy Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how well large language models can understand the different meanings of the discourse particle 'just'.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the capability of LLMs in distinguishing the fine-grained senses of 'just', which is an important discourse particle in English.

Method: Using data created and labeled by expert linguists to test LLMs' ability to recognize different senses of 'just'.

Result: LLMs can differentiate broader categories of 'just' but fail to capture more subtle nuances.

Conclusion: There is a gap in LLMs' understanding of discourse particles like 'just'.

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

Abstract: We propose that benchmarking LLMs on questions which have no reasonable

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluate MT quality for African languages remains challenging due to limited resources. This paper introduces SSA-MTE, a large-scale MTE dataset covering 13 African language pairs, and develops improved evaluation metrics, SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE. It also benchmarks prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that SSA-COMET models perform better than AfriCOMET and are competitive with the best LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for evaluating MT quality for under-resourced African languages face challenges due to limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings. Recent efforts like AfriCOMET have addressed some issues but still have limitations.

Method: Introduce SSA-MTE, develop SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE metrics, and benchmark prompting-based approaches using LLMs.

Result: SSA-COMET models outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive with the strongest LLM evaluated in the study, especially for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: This work provides valuable resources under open licenses to support future research on evaluating MT quality for African languages.

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how large language models can be exploited by malicious agents in multi-agent systems through subtle prompt manipulation, leading to various integrity attacks and highlighting the need for improved security measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems from a multi-party perspective, focusing on integrity attacks caused by malicious agents using prompt manipulation.

Method: Examining four types of attacks: Scapegoater, Boaster, Self-Dealer, and Free-Rider, demonstrating how strategic prompts can introduce biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions.

Result: Strategically crafted prompts can indeed cause systematic biases in MAS, enabling malicious agents to mislead evaluations and manipulate collaborators. Advanced LLM-based monitors are shown to be vulnerable to these attacks.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for secure MAS architectures with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, along with monitoring systems capable of assessing comprehensive risk scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

TL;DR: 研究显示，对于金融情感分类，快速、直观的“系统1”式思考比“系统2”式的缓慢、审慎的推理更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（包括推理型和非推理型）在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集评估不同大型语言模型和提示策略在金融语境下与人类标记的情感的一致性。比较三种专有大型语言模型（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在模拟系统1（快速且直观）或系统2（缓慢且审慎）思考的不同提示范式下的表现，并将其与两个经过金融情感分析微调的小型模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）进行基准测试。进一步探索语言复杂性和注释一致性水平对性能的影响。

Result: 发现推理，无论是通过提示还是固有模型设计，在此任务上并未提高性能。最准确且与人类对齐的模型和方法组合是未经链式思维（CoT）提示的GPT-4o。语言复杂性和注释一致性水平影响性能，推理可能引入过度思考，导致次优预测。

Conclusion: 推理，无论是通过提示还是固有模型设计，在此任务上并未提高性能。最准确且与人类对齐的模型和方法组合是未经链式思维（CoT）提示的GPT-4o。对于金融情感分类，快速、直观的“系统1”式思考比“系统2”式的缓慢、审慎的推理更接近人类判断。我们的结果挑战了更多推理总是导致更好的大型语言模型决策的默认假设，特别是在高风险的金融应用中。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

### [21] [Are LLMs Reliable Translators of Logical Reasoning Across Lexically Diversified Contexts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04575)
*Qingchuan Li,Jiatong Li,Zirui Liu,Mingyue Cheng,Yuting Zeng,Qi Liu,Tongxuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SCALe, a benchmark for evaluating large language models' ability to handle lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks, revealing deficiencies which are addressed by a new method called MenTaL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of large language models as logic translators due to their struggle with lexical diversification, especially since existing benchmarks lack sufficient lexical diversity.

Method: Proposing SCALe, which creates lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions of benchmark datasets, and introducing MenTaL, which guides LLMs to construct a table unifying diverse expressions before translation.

Result: Experiments using SCALe show current LLMs have deficiencies in translating lexically diversified text, and MenTaL improves their performance when applied through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of addressing lexical diversification in logical reasoning tasks for improving the reliability of large language models.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

### [22] [Selecting Demonstrations for Many-Shot In-Context Learning via Gradient Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04579)
*Jianfei Zhang,Bei Li,Jun Bai,Rumei Li,Yanmeng Wang,Chenghua Lin,Wenge Rong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a gradient matching approach for selecting demonstrations in In-Context Learning (ICL) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selecting many-shot demonstrations in ICL are limited to random selection, which may not be optimal.

Method: The proposed method selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between the target task and the selected examples.

Result: The method outperforms random selection on larger LLMs across 9 diverse datasets.

Conclusion: This work provides a more reliable and effective way to perform many-shot ICL.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

*Hongjun Liu,Yilun Zhao,Arman Cohan,Chen Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a training-free method called SUCEA to improve fact-checking systems' ability to handle adversarial claims by decomposing the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by fact-checking systems based on retrieval-augmented language models when dealing with adversarial claims.

Method: Proposing a modular framework called SUCEA that decomposes the task into three steps: Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization, Iterative Evidence Retrieval and Claim Editing, and Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction.

Result: The experiments conducted on two challenging fact-checking datasets showed that the proposed framework significantly improved retrieval and entailment label accuracy, surpassing four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free method can effectively enhance the performance of fact-checking systems in handling adversarial claims.

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark MuSciClaims tests claim verification abilities in scientific figures, showing most vision-language models perform poorly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of readily usable multimodal benchmarks directly testing claim verification abilities in scientific literature.

Method: Introducing a new benchmark MuSciClaims with supported and contradicted claims extracted from scientific articles.

Result: Most vision-language models have low F1 scores (0.3-0.5), with the best achieving 0.77 F1. Models are biased towards judging claims as supported and struggle with localizing evidence, aggregating information across modalities, and understanding figure components.

Conclusion: Most vision-language models perform poorly on verifying claims related to scientific figures.

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels generated from unsupervised data in speech recognition and translation tasks by using large language models.

Method: The method involves using a large language model to refine pseudo-labeled text from automatic speech recognition or automatic speech translation of unsupervised data, and augmenting it by a data filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of knowledge transfer from the large language model.

Result: The result shows that the proposed method, LESS, achieves a notable absolute Word Error Rate (WER) reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech test set, and BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test sets respectively.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the LESS framework is adaptable across different languages, tasks, and domains, and the ablation studies provide new insights into leveraging large language model-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Propose a new method called Safe to verify Chain-of-Thought prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide checkable evidence to mitigate hallucinations in Chain-of-Thought prompting.

Method: Retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework using Lean 4 mathematical language.

Result: Significant performance improvement while providing interpretable and verifiable evidence.

Conclusion: This work is the first to use formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural language content generated by LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

Motivation: Existing datasets for scientific NLI are derived from CS domains, ignoring non-CS domains. The authors aim to address this gap by introducing a new evaluation benchmark.

Method: Established baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Result: The best performing baseline achieved a Macro F1 score of 78.17%, showing substantial room for future improvements.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel scientific NLI evaluation benchmark named MISMATCHED covering three non-CS domains with 2,700 human annotated sentence pairs. Established strong baselines on MISMATCHED using SLMs and LLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Motivation: To address the issue of less diverse outputs from reasoning-optimized models, which limits the effectiveness of TTS.

Method: Categorizing TTS methods into sampling-based, search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies; proposing ADAPT, a method applying prefix tuning with a diversity-focused data strategy.

Result: ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong baselines.

Conclusion: Generative diversity is essential for maximizing TTS effectiveness.

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a

show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in

Method: 基于动态语言表示的几何空间中的概念位置来量化主观视角和创新机会。

Result: 测量的主观视角可以预测个人和群体在未来会创造性地关注和成功结合的想法。视角多样性与创意成就呈正相关，而背景多样性则预示着其相反的结果。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We

### [30] [Static Word Embeddings for Sentence Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04624)
*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces new static word embeddings optimized for sentence semantic representation. The embeddings are improved using sentence-level PCA followed by knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. Models are evaluated on monolingual and cross-lingual tasks showing substantial improvement over existing static models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop static word embeddings that can better represent sentence semantics compared to existing methods.

Method: Extract word embeddings from pre-trained Sentence Transformer, then improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. Sentences are represented by averaging word embeddings during inference.

Result: The proposed model outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks and rivals a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on some datasets.

Conclusion: The method successfully removes irrelevant word embedding components and adjusts vector norms based on word influence on sentence semantics.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

*Zhiyuan Ma,Jiayu Liu,Xianzhen Luo,Zhenya Huang,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Tool-Augmented LLM named Tool-MVR has been proposed which improves tool utilization capabilities and achieves better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models face limitations in tool planning and invocation as well as weak tool reflection abilities.

Method: The method includes Multi-Agent Meta-Verification (MAMV) and Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE).

Result: Tool-MVR shows superior performance on StableToolBench and has strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.

Conclusion: Tool-MVR has achieved state-of-the-art performance and improved tool reflection capabilities.

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for creating AVSR datasets from raw video to improve efficiency and accessibility, demonstrating its effectiveness by building a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of scarce datasets for AVSR, especially for non-English languages, by automating data collection.

Method: Developing a practical approach to generate AVSR datasets from raw video.

Result: The automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese, performing competitively in clean conditions and significantly better in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This method can help expand AVSR to more languages, especially under-resourced ones.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

*Vinay Joshi,Pratik Prabhanjan Brahma,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法(TaDA)，显著减少了内存使用并提高了多种模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统KV缓存量化方法在处理长序列时内存需求过大的问题，提高大规模语言模型部署的可扩展性。

Method: TaDA方法通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除单独处理异常值的需要，无需训练即可实现KV缓存压缩。

Result: TaDA方法减少了KV缓存内存使用至原16位基线的27%，同时保持了相当的准确性，并且无需处理稀疏异常值。

Conclusion: TaDA实现了对KV缓存的高效压缩，无需单独处理稀疏异常值，同时在多种模型上显著提升了准确率，并且将KV缓存内存占用减少到原始16位基线的27%，为长上下文语言模型推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark for evaluating language models' flexible reasoning abilities in dynamic planning scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities mainly focus on static, single-turn scenarios.

Method: Introduced two novel evaluation settings based on the TravelPlanner dataset: sequential constraint introduction across multiple turns and scenarios with prioritized competing constraints.

Result: Analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B revealed that models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly predict their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with constraint prioritization.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on complex planning tasks.

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [35] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the limitations of current alignment strategies for large language models (LLMs) in preventing misuse due to their vulnerability to adversarial attacks exploiting norm conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine the value alignment problem for LLMs and argue that current strategies are inadequate to prevent misuse.

Method: Analyze existing alignment methods and compare them with human deliberative reasoning.

Result: Current alignment methods reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than genuine normative deliberation, making LLMs vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The 'shallow alignment' problem has significant implications for AI safety and regulation, suggesting current approaches are insufficient for mitigating potential harms.

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

TL;DR: Introduces MMRefine, a benchmark for evaluating error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing refinement performance across six error types and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the error refinement capabilities of MLLMs as focus shifts towards enhancing reasoning during inference.

Method: Designing a MultiModal Refinement benchmark named MMRefine which evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and correct errors across six distinct scenarios.

Conclusion: Highlights areas for improvement in effective reasoning enhancement.

Abstract: This paper introduces MMRefine, a MultiModal Refinement benchmark designed to
evaluate the error refinement capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). As the emphasis shifts toward enhancing reasoning during inference,
MMRefine provides a framework that evaluates MLLMs' abilities to detect and
correct errors across six distinct scenarios beyond just comparing final
accuracy before and after refinement. Furthermore, the benchmark analyzes the
refinement performance by categorizing errors into six error types. Experiments
with various open and closed MLLMs reveal bottlenecks and factors impeding
refinement performance, highlighting areas for improvement in effective
reasoning enhancement. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

*Thao Nguyen,Yang Li,Olga Golovneva,Luke Zettlemoyer,Sewoong Oh,Ludwig Schmidt,Xian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes REWIRE, a method to enrich low-quality documents for pre-training large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply, and the availability of high-quality texts is limited.

Method: REWIRE recycles data discarded in existing filtering processes by guided rewriting.

Result: Experiments show that mixing high-quality raw texts and rewritten texts leads to improvements across diverse tasks, and it is more effective than having access to 2x web data.

Conclusion: Recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过大型语言模型和编码策略提升隐式仇恨言论检测，验证了其在中英文数据集上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动检测方法在识别明确仇恨言论方面表现出色，但在更微妙的形式如隐式仇恨言论方面表现不佳。

Method: 引入了新的隐式仇恨言论检测分类法，定义了六种编码策略（codetypes），并通过两种方法将其整合到检测中：1）直接提示大型语言模型根据生成的响应对句子进行分类；2）使用大型语言模型作为编码器并在编码过程中嵌入codetypes。

Result: 实验表明，在中英文数据集上使用codetypes可以提高隐式仇恨言论的检测效果，并验证了该方法在不同语言中的有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入新的分类法和编码策略，有效提升了隐式仇恨言论的检测能力，且其效果在多种语言中得到验证。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

TL;DR: STAND is a new method that speeds up language model reasoning by 60-65% without losing accuracy, applicable to any existing model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between performance and efficiency in reasoning tasks using test-time scaling techniques.

Method: STAND uses stochastic drafting and a logit-based N-gram module, along with optimized sampling and tree construction.

Result: STAND improves token acceptance rates and reduces inference latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while maintaining accuracy. It also outperforms other speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput.

Conclusion: STAND is a model-free speculative decoding approach that accelerates language model reasoning without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Result: Careful selection of hyperparameters and application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly improve performance in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: The study reveals that hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation can significantly enhance translation quality in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT enhances multiple LLMs' performance through competitive self-evolution, surpassing initial models and other baselines with diverse improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diversity and biases in a single LLM's generation and evaluation.

Method: Collective alignment of multiple LLMs through competition and combat, using an Elo-ranking based reputation system for evaluations.

Result: Outperforms initial models and four self-alignment baselines on 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with an average improvement of 7.0%, demonstrates better generalization to unseen tasks and produces more logical, direct, and informative outputs.

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT improves the performance of multiple LLMs across most tasks and datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in self-evolution and generalization.

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful but current evaluation benchmarks focus on STEM fields. A new benchmark called HSSBench is introduced to evaluate MLLMs on Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) tasks in multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM benchmarks do not address the unique needs of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) which require interdisciplinary thinking and integration of knowledge across fields.

Method: HSSBench was created using a data generation pipeline involving domain experts and automated agents. It includes over 13,000 samples across six categories.

Result: HSSBench poses significant challenges even for top-performing MLLMs.

Conclusion: The introduction of HSSBench aims to inspire research into improving MLLMs' cross-disciplinary reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential to advance a broad range of domains. However, current benchmarks for
evaluating MLLMs primarily emphasize general knowledge and vertical
step-by-step reasoning typical of STEM disciplines, while overlooking the
distinct needs and potential of the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS). Tasks
in the HSS domain require more horizontal, interdisciplinary thinking and a
deep integration of knowledge across related fields, which presents unique
challenges for MLLMs, particularly in linking abstract concepts with
corresponding visual representations. Addressing this gap, we present HSSBench,
a dedicated benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs on HSS tasks
in multiple languages, including the six official languages of the United
Nations. We also introduce a novel data generation pipeline tailored for HSS
scenarios, in which multiple domain experts and automated agents collaborate to
generate and iteratively refine each sample. HSSBench contains over 13,000
meticulously designed samples, covering six key categories. We benchmark more
than 20 mainstream MLLMs on HSSBench and demonstrate that it poses significant
challenges even for state-of-the-art models. We hope that this benchmark will
inspire further research into enhancing the cross-disciplinary reasoning
abilities of MLLMs, especially their capacity to internalize and connect
knowledge across fields.

TL;DR: This paper proposes C$^2$EFND, a framework that combines large language models and small language models to detect fake news more accurately and adaptively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of fake news on social media has serious societal impacts. Existing methods struggle with supervised training needs, adapting to changing environments, and keeping knowledge up-to-date.

Method: C$^2$EFND uses a multi-round collaborative learning framework to leverage the strengths of both types of models and includes modules for updating knowledge and retaining prior knowledge.

Result: Experiments show that C$^2$EFND outperforms previous methods in detecting fake news on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed C$^2$EFND framework improves the accuracy and adaptability of fake news detection in continuous emergent scenarios.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore do not effectively capture meaningful improvements in text revisions.

Method: Manual annotation study and investigation of reference-free evaluation metrics, LLM-as-a-judge approaches with and without gold reference.

Result: LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics offer complementary insights.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics is the most reliable method for assessing revision quality.

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates LLMs' internal political states by extending single-axis concepts to multi-dimensions and applying interpretable representation engineering techniques. A four-dimensional political learning framework and a corresponding dataset were constructed for fine-grained political concept vector learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and uncover their internal political states, as well as to avoid concept confounds in analyzing LLMs' political opinions.

Method: Designed a four-dimensional political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for fine-grained political concept vector learning. Conducted experiments on eight open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques.

Result: The political concept vectors can disentangle political concept confounds, have good generalization and robustness in OOD settings, and can intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Conclusion: This work provides a new perspective on understanding LLMs' internal political states and offers a method for detecting and intervening in LLMs.

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

### [46] [MMSU: A Massive Multi-task Spoken Language Understanding and Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04779)
*Dingdong Wang,Jincenzi Wu,Junan Li,Dongchao Yang,Xueyuan Chen,Tianhua Zhang,Helen Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark called MMSU is introduced for understanding and reasoning in spoken language, containing 5,000 audio-question-answer triplets across 47 tasks, aiming to push forward the development of SpeechLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fine-grained perception and complex reasoning capabilities in natural speech which are not yet fully utilized by current SpeechLLMs.

Method: The creation of MMSU benchmark with various linguistic phenomena incorporated, evaluating 14 advanced SpeechLLMs.

Result: Existing models show significant room for improvement according to the rigorous evaluation.

Conclusion: MMSU provides a new standard for assessing spoken language understanding and offers guidance for future research in human-AI speech interaction systems.

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

TL;DR: This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), categorizing them based on architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how different modalities connect to the language backbone and address gaps in existing literature.

Method: Categorizing MLLMs using a framework based on architectural strategies, representation learning techniques, and training paradigms.

Result: Identified emerging patterns in MLLMs developed between 2021 and 2025.

Conclusion: Proposes a taxonomy that offers researchers a structured overview of current integration techniques to guide future model development.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

### [48] [Dissecting Logical Reasoning in LLMs: A Fine-Grained Evaluation and Supervision Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04810)
*Yujun Zhou,Jiayi Ye,Zipeng Ling,Yufei Han,Yue Huang,Haomin Zhuang,Zhenwen Liang,Kehan Guo,Taicheng Guo,Xiangqi Wang,Xiangliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FineLogic is a new way to evaluate how well large language models can reason logically. It looks at three things: how accurate the model is overall, if each step in its reasoning makes sense, and how well it aligns with logical concepts. The study also finds that teaching the model using normal language helps it perform well on different types of tasks, whereas using symbols helps it make clearer reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing logical reasoning in large language models only measure final-answer accuracy, ignoring the quality and structure of the reasoning process.

Method: Introduce FineLogic framework with three dimensions of evaluation: overall benchmark accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. Conduct a study on the effects of different supervision formats during fine-tuning.

Result: Natural language supervision leads to strong generalization on various tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles improve the clarity and structure of inference chains.

Conclusion: FineLogic provides a more thorough and understandable method for evaluating and enhancing logical reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

*Feijun Liu,Huifeng Wang,Kun Wang,Yizhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a new method for machine translation proofreading using a combination of CNN and BERT. It achieves high accuracy and outperforms previous techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce human post-editing efforts by improving machine translation quality.

Method: Hybrid approach combining CNN and BERT for detecting and correcting translation errors.

Result: Achieved 90% accuracy, 89.37% F1 score, and 16.24% MSE on English-German datasets.

Conclusion: Proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance in identifying and fixing mistranslations and omissions.

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

*Nurul Aisyah,Muhammad Dehan Al Kautsar,Arif Hidayat,Raqib Chowdhury,Fajri Koto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study examines the effectiveness of vision-language and large language models in assessing handwritten exam responses from fourth-grade students in Indonesian schools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of AI-driven educational assessment in underrepresented educational contexts.

Method: Evaluation of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646 handwritten exam responses covering Mathematics and English.

Result: VLM struggles with handwriting recognition leading to errors in downstream LLM grading. However, LLM-generated feedback still holds utility despite personalization and contextual relevance limitations.

Conclusion: The study highlights challenges and possibilities of integrating VLM and LLM into real-world classroom assessments.

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work presents an LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic crossword clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and using a verifier system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a new test set for cryptic crossword clues that can be solved without needing crossing words as confirmation.

Method: An LLM-based reasoning system that solves cryptic clues by hypothesizing answers, proposing wordplay explanations, and using a verifier system.

Result: The system establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and The Telegraph newspapers in the UK.

Conclusion: This system provides interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers.

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

### [52] [Joint Evaluation of Answer and Reasoning Consistency for Hallucination Detection in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04832)
*Changyue Wang,Weihang Su,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework named RACE is proposed for detecting hallucination in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of hallucination detection in LRMs which have explicit, multi-step reasoning traces that can be redundant or logically inconsistent.

Method: RACE extracts essential reasoning steps and computes four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning.

Result: RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines across datasets and different LLMs.

Conclusion: RACE offers a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MockConf, a dataset of student interpreting recordings, and InterAlign, a tool for aligning simultaneous interpreting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and automate the task of simultaneous interpreting, there is a need for dedicated datasets and tools.

Method: The authors created MockConf, a dataset of student interpreting recordings, and InterAlign, a tool for parallel word and span annotations.

Result: The dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. The authors also proposed metrics for evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment.

Conclusion: Dataset and tools are released to the community.

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

*Giorgio Biancini,Alessio Ferrato,Carla Limongelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 2, Mistral, and GPT-3.5 in creating Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs). It finds that GPT-3.5 performs best across several metrics. However, there is hesitation among educators to fully embrace AI in education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manual creation of MCQs is resource-intensive and time-consuming. The study aims to explore if LLMs can alleviate this burden.

Method: A comparative analysis of three LLMs was conducted. The researchers injected knowledge into prompts rather than relying on the LLM's existing knowledge to control the source text.

Result: GPT-3.5 created the most effective MCQs based on several metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in generating MCQs, improving educational experiences, but there is resistance towards full AI adoption in education.

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates isometric machine translation using eight open-source LLMs, finding that instruction phrasing and considering multiple outputs can enhance translation quality and length control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation across multiple language pairs under the conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022.

Method: Using eight open-source large language models of different sizes to examine the impact of various prompting strategies, few-shot example numbers, and demonstration selection on translation quality and length control.

Result: LLMs usually generate shorter translations when presented with extreme examples, but isometric demonstrations may cause models to ignore length restrictions. Few-shot prompting generally enhances translation quality, but further improvements are limited across different shot settings.

Conclusion: Considering multiple outputs can improve the trade-off between translation length and quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance for certain language pairs.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: 尽管UD被广泛认为是最成功的跨语言句法表示的语法学框架，但其有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将UD集成到预训练的语言模型中，并评估UD是否能改善其性能。

Result: 在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务上，使用UD的模型比不使用UD的模型平均提高了3.85％的准确率和6.08％的F1分数。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，使用UD可以显著提高跨语言对抗性释义识别任务上的准确率和F1分数。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

TL;DR: This paper presents ICPC-Eval, a new benchmark for evaluating large language models' coding and reasoning abilities in competitive programming scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks and metrics are insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models in real competition environments and fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models.

Method: ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from recent ICPC contests, with a robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation toolkit.

Result: The results show that top-tier reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their in-context reasoning potential, and these models still lag behind top-performing human teams.

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval provides a challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, an effective test-time scaling evaluation metric, and underscores the significant challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities.

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps is introduced as a new benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to manage state in complex, narrative-based reasoning tasks, revealing limitations in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to adequately test LLMs' ability to handle nested narrative reasoning due to lack of realistic distractors or inability to separate context length from reasoning complexity.

Method: Introducing Verbose ListOps, which converts computational tasks into narrative stories, requiring internal computation and state management.

Result: Experiments show top LLMs perform poorly on Verbose ListOps despite handling raw ListOps equations well, highlighting an issue with state management in complex narratives.

Conclusion: Leading LLMs struggle with nested narrative reasoning, especially when managing state among semantically-relevant distractions. Verbose ListOps exposes this limitation and provides a way to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop ASR systems for low-resource languages more effectively

Method: Combining hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models

Result: WER reductions of 32% relative over the best fine-tuned Whisper model

Conclusion: We demonstrate that our proposed method yields substantial performance gains over the current state-of-the-art fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: Investigating multilingual tutor-student interactions using large language models to provide effective instructional support across different languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to examine the ability of large language models to provide effective instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically grounded reasoning tasks.

Method: A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. The study explores 352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies.

Result: Multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native language.

Conclusion: This work offers practical insights for developing multilingual, LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Motivation: 解决神经机器翻译在处理词义模糊和上下文理解问题上的不足，特别是在电子商务领域的应用。

Method: 创建了一个新的捷克语到波兰语的电子商务产品翻译数据集ConECT，并结合图像和产品元数据；测试了视觉语言模型以及如何将上下文信息融入文本到文本模型的方法。

Conclusion: 加入上下文信息可以改善机器翻译的质量，研究中创建的数据集公开可用。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when labeled data is scarce but unlabeled audio and labeled data from related domains are available.

Method: Incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline that includes integrating in-domain labeled data and auxiliary dataset, and iteratively refining pseudo-labels using filtering techniques.

Result: Relative improvements of 4%, 22.3% on Wow corpus and 24.8% on Fisher corpus were achieved compared to single-step fine-tuning with random selection.

Conclusion: The proposed incremental semi-supervised learning pipeline improves ASR model fine-tuning performance in data-scarce scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts.

Method: Systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data.

Result: LLMs still face challenges in performing expert-level comprehension, have some similarities with experts in comprehending local information better than global information, and can be unreliable sometimes by reaching correct answers through flawed comprehension processes.

Conclusion: Focus more on the comprehension process and ensure all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training for improving LLMs.

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: Existing methods often require complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework called AR-Checker that checks the robustness of large language models by generating tricky math problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the robustness issues of large language models and their unexpected failures in simple reasoning tasks.

Method: The AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants using multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification.

Result: Experiments show that AR-Checker performs well on mathematical tasks and even surpasses expectations on non-mathematical benchmarks.

Conclusion: AR-Checker is an effective tool for testing the robustness of large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new benchmark for evaluating LLM judges through debate speech evaluation, analyzing how well state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLM judges' abilities in evaluating debate speeches which require a deep understanding across various aspects like argument strength, coherence, style, etc.

Method: Using a dataset of over 600 annotated debate speeches to conduct an in-depth analysis.

Result: Larger models can approximate individual human judgments in some ways but differ significantly in overall judgment behavior. Frontier LLMs can generate persuasive speeches at a human level.

Conclusion: The study reveals that while LLMs show promise in certain aspects of debate speech evaluation, there are still notable differences in their overall performance compared to humans.

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

### [70] [Does It Make Sense to Speak of Introspection in Large Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05068)
*Iulia Comşa,Murray Shanahan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper discusses the concept of introspection in large language models (LLMs) and presents two examples of self-reports from LLMs. The first example involves an LLM describing its own creative writing process, which is argued not to be a valid example of introspection. The second example involves an LLM correctly inferring the value of its own temperature parameter, which is considered a minimal example of introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities of LLMs raise questions about how to interpret their self-reports and whether the concept of introspection can be meaningfully applied to them.

Method: Two examples of apparent introspective self-reports from LLMs were presented and critiqued.

Result: The first example was argued not to be a valid example of introspection, while the second example was considered a minimal example of introspection.

Conclusion: The study suggests that the concept of introspection can be meaningfully applied to LLMs, but only in a very limited sense.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This work investigates the poor performance of combining RLHF with colloquial subtitle translation tasks in large language models. It identifies the divergence between offline reward model and online LLM due to distributional shift as the cause. To solve this problem, an adversarial training framework called RIVAL is proposed, which formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. The method also incorporates quantitative preference reward into the RM for better training stability and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore why the combination of RLHF with colloquial subtitle translation tasks performs poorly in large language models and to address this issue.

Method: Proposing RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. It also incorporates quantitative preference reward into the RM.

Result: The proposed adversarial training framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Conclusion: RIVAL effectively addresses the divergence issue caused by distributional shift and enhances the performance of translation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve large language models' understanding of self-harm signals on social media by using an emoji sensitivity matrix and a curated dataset for annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the challenge of identifying self-harm intent in social media posts which are often expressed subtly and context-dependently, with current LLMs struggling to interpret these implicit cues.

Method: A new framework is developed that includes enriching inputs with a curated set of emojis, fine-tuning LLMs for multiple tasks including self-harm detection and intent extraction, and generating explainable rationales for predictions. The framework uses the SHINES dataset and the CESM-100.

Result: The proposed method improves LLM performance in detecting self-harm signals and explaining predictions across different scenarios, showing commendable enhancement in handling the ambiguity of self-harm signals.

Conclusion: The study concludes that coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues through the use of a curated emoji matrix and dataset significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and explain self-harm signals on social media.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex interactions shaping the commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities.

Method: An image-based framework using street view imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B) to construct a Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) and analyze it with GPT-4-based perception modeling.

Result: Moderate vehicle presence enhances commercial access but excessive on-street parking reduces walkability and satisfaction, while greenery and cleanliness increase satisfaction but have weak associations with pricing. Street width moderates vehicle presence impacts.

Conclusion: AI-assisted perception can capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of commercial success, advancing both theory and methodology in urban design and revitalization.

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

TL;DR: A novel framework named CL-ISR combines contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning to enhance misleading text detection on social media.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research area due to its potential to cause public misunderstanding, social panic and economic losses.

Method: The proposed framework, CL-ISR, combines contrastive learning and implicit stance reasoning. Contrastive learning improves the model's ability to learn semantic differences between truthful and misleading texts, while implicit stance reasoning explores the potential stance tendencies in the text and their relationships with related topics.

Result: The integration of these two algorithms into CL-ISR enhances the detection accuracy of misleading texts on social media, especially in linguistically complex situations.

Conclusion: The CL-ISR framework significantly improves the detection effect by leveraging the discriminative power of contrastive learning and the interpretive depth of stance reasoning.

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach to spoken language assessment by combining acoustic and semantic features to improve evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome the limitations of BERT and wav2vec 2.0, where BERT-based methods lack prosodic and phonetic cues while W2V-based methods lack semantic interpretability in spoken language assessment.

Method: The method involved integrating wav2vec 2.0 with a Phi-4 multimodal large language model using a score fusion strategy.

Result: The result was a system that achieved an RMSE of 0.375 on the official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, outperforming most other systems.

Conclusion: The proposed system integrating W2V with Phi-4 MLLM achieved a competitive RMSE of 0.375, ranking second in the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025.

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

Motivation: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED) is critical for document understanding in specialized domains, but it overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Method: DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.

Result: Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine LLMs, DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot, transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines.

Conclusion: DiCoRe has been shown to be a strong zero-shot ED framework, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains over the best baseline.

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

*Taiga Someya,Anej Svete,Brian DuSell,Timothy J. O'Donnell,Mario Giulianelli,Ryan Cotterell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates inductive biases in neural language models using a quantitative framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if neural language model biases align with human processing constraints.

Method: Introduce m-local entropy, an information-theoretic measure, and test it on perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by PFSAs.

Result: Higher m-local entropy makes it harder for Transformer and LSTM language models to learn, suggesting sensitivity to local statistical structures similar to humans.

Conclusion: Neural language models share similar sensitivities to human processing constraints regarding local statistical structures.

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Investigate how large audio-language models perceive auditory attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpreting behavior and improving performance of large audio-language models.

Method: Vocabulary projection on three state-of-the-art LALMs to track attribute information evolution.

Result: Attribute information generally decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and early-layer attribute resolution correlates with better accuracy. LALMs rely on querying auditory inputs rather than aggregating information in hidden states.

Conclusion: Our findings provide insights into auditory attribute processing and suggest ways to enhance LALMs.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

### [79] [Do Large Language Models Judge Error Severity Like Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05142)
*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to replicate human judgment on error severity in image descriptions. Humans perceive varying severity levels based on visual context, whereas most LLMs underrate gender errors and overrate colour errors. Doubao shows human-like ranking but lacks clarity, while DeepSeek-V3 surprisingly performs best in aligning with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLMs can accurately replicate human judgments of error severity in image descriptions.

Method: Systematically comparing human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled semantic errors in both unimodal and multimodal settings.

Result: Humans assign different severity levels to error types with visual context amplifying severity for colour and type errors. Most LLMs rate gender errors low and colour errors high, differing from humans. Doubao mimics human severity ranking but lacks clarity, and DeepSeek-V3 outperforms others in alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: LLMs show mixed performance in replicating human error severity judgments. Visual perception grounding and social norm internalization impact their evaluations differently than humans.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

*Chenyu Lin,Yilin Wen,Du Su,Fei Sun,Muhan Chen,Chenfu Bao,Zhonghou Lv*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Knowledgeable-r1, an improved retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that balances reliance on retrieved contexts and the model's own knowledge. It achieves better robustness and reasoning accuracy, particularly excelling by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems overly depend on retrieved contexts, which may lead to inaccuracies and neglect of the model's inherent knowledge.

Method: Proposes Knowledgeable-r1, which uses joint sampling and defines multi-policy distributions to encourage self-integrated use of parametric and contextual knowledge.

Result: Knowledgeable-r1 improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in various tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual scenarios and showing consistent improvements in RAG tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Knowledgeable-r1 effectively addresses the imbalance issue in current RAG systems and demonstrates significant performance enhancements.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: This paper studies how large language models represent social, demographic, and gender biases internally using a mechanistic interpretability approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how biases are represented within models like GPT-2 and Llama2 and how stable and generalizable these representations are.

Method: Adopting a mechanistic interpretability approach, the authors explore different metrics to identify internal edges responsible for biased behavior and perform systematic ablations.

Result: Bias-related computations are highly localized in a small subset of layers, and the identified components change across fine-tuning settings. Removing these components reduces biased outputs but also affects other NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The study reveals that bias-related computations are highly localized and can affect other NLP tasks when removed.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

TL;DR: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, reducing latency and token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, limiting the performance in LLM-based RAG.

Method: ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality.

Result: ECoRAG outperforms existing compression methods and is highly cost-efficient.

Conclusion: ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks and is cost-efficient.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: This paper introduces RELIC to evaluate LLMs' instruction-following ability through language recognition tasks, revealing their limitations on complex grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the ability of large language models to follow instructions without examples of inputs and outputs.

Method: Introducing the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate instruction following using language recognition.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs show near-chance performance on more complex grammars and samples, and rely on shallow heuristics instead of following complex instructions as the complexity of the language recognition task increases.

Conclusion: The study finds that the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC can be predicted by the complexity of the grammar and example strings, and even the most advanced LLMs perform poorly on complex grammars.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Motivation: To address intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns related to training LLMs on unlicensed text.

Method: Collect, curate, and release the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text designed for LLM pretraining.

Result: Two 7 billion parameter LLMs trained on the Common Pile achieved competitive performance to LLMs trained on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets.

Conclusion: The Common Pile v0.1 and the trained models provide a viable alternative for training LLMs while addressing IP and ethical concerns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2

code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for

Motivation: To explore self-supervised objectives for character-level tasks, which have not been explored much despite the scarcity of large-scale unlabeled data for many languages.

Method: Investigating the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.

Result: Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Objectives with stronger inductive biases rarely outperform standard CMLM.

Conclusion: Autoencoding is the most effective when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases.

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified system for representing both continuous and discontinuous structures in natural languages by incorporating three different grammar formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified approach for analyzing syntactic discontinuity across different languages.

Method: Integrating Phrase Structure Grammar, Dependency Grammar, and Categorial Grammar into a single mathematical derivation framework.

Result: A unified representation that can analyze both continuous and discontinuous expressions in natural languages.

Conclusion: The proposed system offers a converging method for analyzing discontinuous structures by combining aspects from multiple formalisms.

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a three-step reasoning process for hallucination detection, which improves the accuracy of entailment decisions by breaking down the text into smaller facts and finding evidence for each fact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy of hallucination detection by guiding large language models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process.

Method: Defining a three-step reasoning process consisting of claim decomposition, sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and aggregated classification.

Result: The proposed reasoning process leads to increased performance in hallucination detection.

Conclusion: Guided reasoning can improve the quality of intermediate reasoning steps in hallucination detection.

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Micro-Act, a framework for resolving knowledge conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which improves question answering accuracy across various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge conflicts in RAG systems between external knowledge and parametric knowledge of LLMs negatively affect downstream tasks like question answering.

Method: Micro-Act uses a hierarchical action space to perceive context complexity and adaptively breaks down knowledge sources into fine-grained comparisons for better identification and mitigation of inconsistencies.

Result: Micro-Act shows significant improvements in QA accuracy over existing methods on five benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in temporal and semantic conflict types.

Conclusion: Micro-Act effectively resolves knowledge conflicts in RAG systems and maintains robust performance on non-conflict questions, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error propagation and sub-optimal performance in agentic workflows caused by poorly designed prompts limit system reliability and scalability.

Method: An inference-time prompt optimization method named ProRefine uses textual feedback from LLMs to refine prompts dynamically for multi-step reasoning tasks.

Result: ProRefine outperforms zero-shot Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points on five benchmark mathematical reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: This approach not only enhances accuracy but also enables smaller models to perform as well as larger ones, promoting efficient and scalable AI deployment.

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,

### [92] [Constrained Entropic Unlearning: A Primal-Dual Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05314)
*Taha Entesari,Arman Hatami,Rinat Khaziev,Anil Ramakrishna,Mahyar Fazlyab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method for unlearning information from Large Language Models is proposed, formulated as a constrained optimization problem. This method uses a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for Large Language Models to unlearn sensitive or outdated information in real-world applications.

Method: Constrained optimization with a logit-margin flattening loss for forgetting and a hard constraint for retention, solved by a primal-dual algorithm.

Result: The method performs well on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks across different LLM architectures, showing better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and robust way for LLMs to unlearn specific information without significantly affecting their performance on retained data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

*Mihran Miroyan,Tsung-Han Wu,Logan King,Tianle Li,Jiayi Pan,Xinyan Hu,Wei-Lin Chiang,Anastasios N. Angelopoulos,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introducing Search Arena, a large-scale human-preference dataset for search-augmented language models, which reveals user preferences influenced by citation numbers and source types, and shows that web search can improve performance in non-search settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for analyzing search-augmented language models are limited in scale and scope, focusing mainly on static, single-turn fact-checking questions. This paper aims to address this gap by creating a diverse, multi-turn dataset that captures various intents and languages.

Method: The authors crowd-sourced a large-scale dataset called Search Arena, containing over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset includes full system traces and around 12,000 human preference votes.

Result: Analysis of the dataset showed that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when cited content doesn't directly support claims, highlighting a discrepancy between perceived and actual credibility. Preferences also vary based on cited sources, with community-driven platforms generally preferred over static encyclopedic sources. Performance assessments revealed that web search can enhance performance in non-search settings but negatively impacts it in search settings when relying solely on parametric knowledge.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a valuable resource for evaluating search-augmented language models through the creation of Search Arena. It highlights important insights into user preferences and model performance across different settings, encouraging further research in this area.

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

*Anirudh Bharadwaj,Chaitanya Malaviya,Nitish Joshi,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores how language models are biased towards superficial characteristics rather than meaningful ones due to training data issues. It finds that preference models often favor responses with exaggerated biases and are more aligned with models than humans. A method using counterfactual data augmentation is proposed to reduce this miscalibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the systematic miscalibration in language models caused by training data biases.

Method: Systematically investigating the relationship between training data biases and preference model miscalibration across five features of language model generations, and proposing a post-training method using counterfactual data augmentation.

Result: Preference models favor responses with magnified biases in over 60% of instances, showing high miscalibration compared to human preferences. The proposed method reduces miscalibration and skew difference effectively.

Conclusion: Targeted debiasing through counterfactual data augmentation is an effective way to build reliable preference models.

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require retraining when switching base models which can be challenging due to data constraints.

Method: Projection of source adjustments into the target model's weight space using subspace and null space similarities and selective targeting of aligned layers.

Result: Successful knowledge transfer and comparable performance without retraining on established text-to-image models.

Conclusion: ProLoRA provides a solution to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by enabling zero-shot adaptation in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce ProLoRA, enabling zero-shot adaptation of parameter-efficient
fine-tuning in text-to-image diffusion models. ProLoRA transfers pre-trained
low-rank adjustments (e.g., LoRA) from a source to a target model without
additional training data. This overcomes the limitations of traditional methods
that require retraining when switching base models, often challenging due to
data constraints. ProLoRA achieves this via projection of source adjustments
into the target model's weight space, leveraging subspace and null space
similarities and selectively targeting aligned layers. Evaluations on
established text-to-image models demonstrate successful knowledge transfer and
comparable performance without retraining.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ensuring contextual integrity (CI) is crucial for autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users. This study explores two approaches: prompting large language models (LLMs) to reason about CI and developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to instill CI reasoning in models. A small but diverse synthetic dataset was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in reducing inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure contextual integrity (CI) for autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users.

Method: 1. Prompting LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. 2. Developing a RL framework to instill CI reasoning in models.

Result: The method significantly reduced inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Improvements transferred to established CI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Achieving CI in autonomous agents requires reasoning about the context in which they operate. The proposed methods effectively reduce privacy leakage without compromising task performance.

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习系统在复杂任务上的协调与沟通能力有限，且在未见过的场景中泛化性能不足。因此，研究者希望利用大型语言模型来增强这些能力。

Method: LLM-MARL框架包括Coordinator（目标生成器）、Communicator（通讯器）和Memory（记忆模块），并结合了PPO算法以及语言条件损失和LLM查询门控机制。

Result: LLM-MARL在Google Research Football, MAgent Battle和StarCraft II等环境中展现了更好的胜率、协调得分和零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLM-MARL框架通过结合大型语言模型和多智能体强化学习，在模拟游戏环境中提升了协调性、沟通能力和泛化能力。实验表明其在多个基准测试中的表现优于MAPPO和QMIX。

Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large
language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to
enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game
environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator,
Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate
symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines
PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is
evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results
show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination
score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal
generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to
performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role
specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling
and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent,
cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for
leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI
collaboration.

Motivation: To address the issue of large language models often hallucinating industrial codes and emission factors, which can negatively impact regulatory and investment decisions.

Method: A retrieval-augmented generation framework named CircuGraphRAG that uses a knowledge graph containing 117,380 industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission data, allowing for structured multi-hop reasoning.

Conclusion: CircuGraphRAG offers fact-checked, regulation-compliant assistance for circular economy planning, thereby promoting dependable, low-carbon resource decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific

translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of keeping both large language model agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and values.

Method: HADA wraps algorithms or LLMs in role-specific stakeholder agents, which expose conversational APIs for querying, steering, auditing, or contesting decisions.

Result: A cloud-native proof of concept was created, packaging a production credit-scoring model and deploying it on Docker/Kubernetes/Python. Five scripted retail-bank scenarios were used to demonstrate how target changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow through the architecture.

Conclusion: The evaluation demonstrated complete coverage of six predefined objectives, and contributions include an open-source HADA architecture, a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in multi-agent systems, and empirical evidence of improved accuracy, transparency, and ethical compliance.

Abstract: We present HADA (Human-AI Agent Decision Alignment), a protocol- and
framework agnostic reference architecture that keeps both large language model
(LLM) agents and legacy algorithms aligned with organizational targets and
values. HADA wraps any algorithm or LLM in role-specific stakeholder agents --
business, data-science, audit, ethics, and customer -- each exposing
conversational APIs so that technical and non-technical actors can query,
steer, audit, or contest every decision across strategic, tactical, and
real-time horizons. Alignment objectives, KPIs, and value constraints are
expressed in natural language and are continuously propagated, logged, and
versioned while thousands of heterogeneous agents run on different
orchestration stacks. A cloud-native proof of concept packages a production
credit-scoring model (getLoanDecision) and deploys it on
Docker/Kubernetes/Python; five scripted retail-bank scenarios show how target
changes, parameter tweaks, explanation requests, and ethics triggers flow end
to end through the architecture. Evaluation followed the Design-Science
Research Methodology. Walkthrough observation and log inspection demonstrated
complete coverage of six predefined objectives: every role could invoke
conversational control, trace KPIs and value constraints, detect and mitigate
ZIP-code bias, and reproduce full decision lineage, independent of the
underlying LLM or agent library. Contributions: (1) an open-source HADA
architecture, (2) a mid-range design theory for human-AI alignment in
multi-agent systems, and (3) empirical evidence that framework-agnostic,
protocol-compliant stakeholder agents improve accuracy, transparency, and
ethical compliance in real-world decision pipelines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automatic skill discovery framework called EXIF is proposed to help large language model (LLM) agents acquire skills in environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creating training datasets for LLM agents is challenging due to manual effort requirements and invalid task proposals from LLMs.

Method: EXIF uses an exploration-first strategy with an exploration agent (Alice) generating feasible skills for a target agent (Bob), who learns these skills. An iterative feedback loop between Alice and Bob refines skill generation.

Result: EXIF successfully discovers meaningful skills and improves agent capabilities in experiments on Webshop and Crafter.

Conclusion: EXIF can create a self-evolving system for LLM-powered agents, enhancing their performance without human intervention.

Abstract: Training large language model (LLM) agents to acquire necessary skills and
perform diverse tasks within an environment is gaining interest as a means to
enable open-endedness. However, creating the training dataset for their skill
acquisition faces several challenges. Manual trajectory collection requires
significant human effort. Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks
to learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are
actually feasible. Moreover, the generated data may not provide a meaningful
learning signal, as agents often already perform well on the proposed tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel automatic skill discovery framework EXIF for
LLM-powered agents, designed to improve the feasibility of generated target
behaviors while accounting for the agents' capabilities. Our method adopts an
exploration-first strategy by employing an exploration agent (Alice) to train
the target agent (Bob) to learn essential skills in the environment.
Specifically, Alice first interacts with the environment to retrospectively
generate a feasible, environment-grounded skill dataset, which is then used to
train Bob. Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice
evaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback
then guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data
generation process. Experiments on Webshop and Crafter demonstrate EXIF's
ability to effectively discover meaningful skills and iteratively expand the
capabilities of the trained agent without any human intervention, achieving
substantial performance improvements. Interestingly, we observe that setting
Alice to the same model as Bob also notably improves performance, demonstrating
EXIF's potential for building a self-evolving system.

Result: 通过对8个模型和7个基准测试的实证轨迹分析，发现一个平衡方差捕捉和可行性的秩40投影可以解释约50%的方差，并确定了四种潜在的推理模式。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够实现低成本的推理模拟，提供研究和预测大型语言模型中关键转换如不一致状态或其它失败的工具。

Abstract: Transformer LMs show emergent reasoning that resists mechanistic
understanding. We offer a statistical physics framework for continuous-time
chain-of-thought reasoning dynamics. We model sentence-level hidden state
trajectories as a stochastic dynamical system on a lower-dimensional manifold.
This drift-diffusion system uses latent regime switching to capture diverse
reasoning phases, including misaligned states or failures. Empirical
trajectories (8 models, 7 benchmarks) show a rank-40 projection (balancing
variance capture and feasibility) explains ~50% variance. We find four latent
reasoning regimes. An SLDS model is formulated and validated to capture these
features. The framework enables low-cost reasoning simulation, offering tools
to study and predict critical transitions like misaligned states or other LM
failures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated experiments can be costly when run at scale, and developing the capacity to filter feasible hypotheses can reduce costs and improve the likelihood of significant discoveries.

Method: Introducing Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of hypotheses framed as claims.

Result: Strong baselines including retrieval augmented generation over scientific literature and code generation failed to exceed 72% performance on this task, which suggests the difficulty for current models but also highlights the potential to accelerate scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their feasibility is crucial for improving discovery systems' efficiency and discovery significance.

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

TL;DR: This paper presents a graph-based framework for multi-table Question Answering (QA) using human-curated relational knowledge to improve schema linking and join path encoding. The method uses pruning and sub-path merging to enhance efficiency and coherence when constructing reasoning chains from natural language queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-table QA struggle with complex, real-world scenarios due to unreliable schema linking across numerous and diverse columns.

Method: A graph-based framework leveraging human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links and join paths. The method includes pruning and sub-path merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks and a large-scale dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: This is the first multi-table QA system applied to complex industrial tabular data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in table Question Answering
(Table QA). However, extending these capabilities to multi-table QA remains
challenging due to unreliable schema linking across complex tables. Existing
methods based on semantic similarity work well only on simplified hand-crafted
datasets and struggle to handle complex, real-world scenarios with numerous and
diverse columns. To address this, we propose a graph-based framework that
leverages human-curated relational knowledge to explicitly encode schema links
and join paths. Given a natural language query, our method searches this graph
to construct interpretable reasoning chains, aided by pruning and sub-path
merging strategies to enhance efficiency and coherence. Experiments on both
standard benchmarks and a realistic, large-scale dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-table
QA system applied to truly complex industrial tabular data.

Result: The system has been deployed at a national organization to monitor up to 5 million data points daily, improving reviewer speed efficiency by 54x compared to traditional alert-based methods.

Conclusion: Human-centered AI can potentially transform public health decision-making.

Abstract: Public health experts need scalable approaches to monitor large volumes of
health data (e.g., cases, hospitalizations, deaths) for outbreaks or data
quality issues. Traditional alert-based monitoring systems struggle with modern
public health data monitoring systems for several reasons, including that
alerting thresholds need to be constantly reset and the data volumes may cause
application lag. Instead, we propose a ranking-based monitoring paradigm that
leverages new AI anomaly detection methods. Through a multi-year
interdisciplinary collaboration, the resulting system has been deployed at a
national organization to monitor up to 5,000,000 data points daily. A
three-month longitudinal deployed evaluation revealed a significant improvement
in monitoring objectives, with a 54x increase in reviewer speed efficiency
compared to traditional alert-based methods. This work highlights the potential

TL;DR: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains, especially in large markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains.

Method: Evaluated several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks.

Result: Top-performing models struggle to resolve instability in large markets, but parameter-efficient fine-tuning improves performance in small markets.

Conclusion: More sophisticated strategies are needed to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning
tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet
their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in
combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core
framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which
require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We
evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based
reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability
detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to
systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling
ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning
struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify
blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in
small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large
instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve
LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.

Conclusion: Provides detailed insights to improve LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving complex
mathematical tasks, existing evaluation paradigms rely solely on a coarse
measure of overall answer accuracy, which are insufficient for assessing their
authentic capabilities. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CogMath}, which
comprehensively assesses LLMs' mathematical abilities through the lens of human
cognition. Specifically, inspired by psychological theories, CogMath formalizes
human reasoning process into 3 stages: \emph{problem comprehension},
\emph{problem solving}, and \emph{solution summarization}. Within these stages,
we investigate perspectives such as numerical calculation, knowledge, and
counterfactuals, and design a total of 9 fine-grained evaluation dimensions. In
each dimension, we develop an ``\emph{Inquiry}-\emph{Judge}-\emph{Reference}''
multi-agent system to generate inquiries that assess LLMs' mastery from this
dimension. An LLM is considered to truly master a problem only when excelling
in all inquiries from the 9 dimensions. By applying CogMath on three
benchmarks, we reveal that the mathematical capabilities of 7 mainstream LLMs
are overestimated by 30\%-40\%. Moreover, we locate their strengths and
weaknesses across specific stages/dimensions, offering in-depth insights to
further enhance their reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STPR is a new method that uses large language models to turn informal instructions from natural language into executable code for robotic navigation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make it easier to incorporate complex constraints expressed in natural language into robotic navigation planning problems.

Method: Develop a framework called STPR which utilizes large language models to generate Python functions from 'do not do' instructions.

Result: STPR can accurately describe complex mathematical constraints and works well when applied to point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. It performs well in a simulated environment with short runtimes.

Conclusion: STPR ensures full compliance across several constraints and scenarios and can work with smaller, code-specific LLMs at low inference cost.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
robotic navigation that incorporates complex spatial, mathematical, and
conditional constraints from natural language into the planning problem. Such
constraints can be informal yet highly complex, making it challenging to
translate into a formal description that can be passed on to a planning
algorithm. In this paper, we propose STPR, a constraint generation framework
that uses LLMs to translate constraints (expressed as instructions on ``what
not to do'') into executable Python functions. STPR leverages the LLM's strong
coding capabilities to shift the problem description from language into
structured and transparent code, thus circumventing complex reasoning and
avoiding potential hallucinations. We show that these LLM-generated functions
accurately describe even complex mathematical constraints, and apply them to
point cloud representations with traditional search algorithms. Experiments in
a simulated Gazebo environment show that STPR ensures full compliance across
several constraints and scenarios, while having short runtimes. We also verify
that STPR can be used with smaller, code-specific LLMs, making it applicable to
a wide range of compact models at low inference cost.

TL;DR: Leverage large language models to automatically generate high-quality schemas for knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure data quality in Semantic Web and natural language processing by automating schema creation.

Method: Use large language models to generate schemas based on local and global information from knowledge graphs.

Result: Successfully generated validating schemas in Shape Expressions using LLM-based pipelines.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of LLMs in scalable, automated schema generation for large knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Schemas are vital for ensuring data quality in the Semantic Web and natural
language processing. Traditionally, their creation demands substantial
involvement from knowledge engineers and domain experts. Leveraging the
impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in related tasks like
ontology engineering, we explore automatic schema generation using LLMs. To
bridge the resource gap, we introduce two datasets: YAGO Schema and Wikidata
EntitySchema, along with evaluation metrics. The LLM-based pipelines
effectively utilize local and global information from knowledge graphs (KGs) to
generate validating schemas in Shape Expressions (ShEx). Experiments
demonstrate LLMs' strong potential in producing high-quality ShEx schemas,
paving the way for scalable, automated schema generation for large KGs.
Furthermore, our benchmark introduces a new challenge for structured
generation, pushing the limits of LLMs on syntactically rich formalisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agricultural intelligence systems lack contextual understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder farmers. General-purpose LLMs are too generic or unrealistic for farming applications.

Method: OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer learning. It includes a unified agricultural knowledge base, a neural agricultural knowledge graph, an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system, and a causal transparency mechanism.

Result: OpenAg aims to bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and tacit farmer expertise to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

Conclusion: OpenAg advances agricultural AGI by addressing key limitations of current systems through its innovative combination of technologies and components.

Abstract: Agriculture is undergoing a major transformation driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), machine learning, and knowledge representation technologies.
However, current agricultural intelligence systems often lack contextual
understanding, explainability, and adaptability, especially for smallholder
farmers with limited resources. General-purpose large language models (LLMs),
while powerful, typically lack the domain-specific knowledge and contextual
reasoning needed for practical decision support in farming. They tend to
produce recommendations that are too generic or unrealistic for real-world
applications. To address these challenges, we present OpenAg, a comprehensive
framework designed to advance agricultural artificial general intelligence
(AGI). OpenAg combines domain-specific foundation models, neural knowledge
graphs, multi-agent reasoning, causal explainability, and adaptive transfer
learning to deliver context-aware, explainable, and actionable insights. The
system includes: (i) a unified agricultural knowledge base that integrates
scientific literature, sensor data, and farmer-generated knowledge; (ii) a
neural agricultural knowledge graph for structured reasoning and inference;
(iii) an adaptive multi-agent reasoning system where AI agents specialize and
collaborate across agricultural domains; and (iv) a causal transparency
mechanism that ensures AI recommendations are interpretable, scientifically
grounded, and aligned with real-world constraints. OpenAg aims to bridge the
gap between scientific knowledge and the tacit expertise of experienced farmers
to support scalable and locally relevant agricultural decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes.

Method: First employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features and polynomial basis functions.

Result: Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties.

Conclusion: This paper also serves as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in
scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack
convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional
numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that
transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to
a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features,
followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features
(Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination
leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at
approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and
stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide
high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical
analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly
enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types
while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves
as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

### [112] [Look Before You Leap: A GUI-Critic-R1 Model for Pre-Operative Error Diagnosis in GUI Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04614)
*Yuyang Wanyan,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Haowei Liu,Junyang Wang,Jiabo Ye,Yutong Kou,Ming Yan,Fei Huang,Xiaoshan Yang,Weiming Dong,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a pre-operative critic mechanism called GUI-Critic-R1, which enhances the reliability of actions in GUI automation tasks by providing effective feedback prior to execution. The model uses a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization strategy and includes a novel suggestion reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI automation requires step-by-step decision-making in online interactive environments with low tolerance for errors. Existing methods lack reliable critic models to ensure accurate and safe actions.

Method: The authors propose GUI-Critic-R1, which incorporates a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization strategy and a novel suggestion reward. They also develop a reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create GUI-Critic-Train and GUI-Critic-Test datasets.

Result: Static experiments on GUI-Critic-Test show that GUI-Critic-R1 outperforms current MLLMs in critic accuracy. Dynamic evaluations on GUI automation benchmarks demonstrate improved success rates and operational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed GUI-Critic-R1 model significantly improves critic accuracy and operational efficiency in GUI automation tasks by providing reliable pre-operative feedback.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been
extensively utilized for multimodal reasoning tasks, including Graphical User
Interface (GUI) automation. Unlike general offline multimodal tasks, GUI
automation is executed in online interactive environments, necessitating
step-by-step decision-making based on real-time status of the environment. This
task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any
mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to
irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we
introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback
prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and
correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient
Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative
critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance
the reliability of the model's feedback. Furthermore, we develop a
reasoning-bootstrapping based data collection pipeline to create a
GUI-Critic-Train and a GUI-Critic-Test, filling existing gaps in GUI critic
data. Static experiments on the GUI-Critic-Test across both mobile and web
domains reveal that our GUI-Critic-R1 offers significant advantages in critic
accuracy compared to current MLLMs. Dynamic evaluation on GUI automation
benchmark further highlights the effectiveness and superiority of our model, as
evidenced by improved success rates and operational efficiency.

*Lucas Irwin,Arda Kaz,Peiyao Sheng,Pramod Viswanath*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new benchmark called CHANCERY is introduced to assess legal reasoning capabilities related to corporate governance, presenting challenges even to top-tier AI models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets focused on reasoning tasks within the legal domain.

Method: Introducing a new benchmark named CHANCERY for testing legal reasoning abilities related to corporate governance.

Result: State-of-the-art reasoning models achieved moderate accuracy, indicating the complexity of the benchmark.

Conclusion: The CHANCERY benchmark presents a challenging test for advanced reasoning models in the context of corporate governance.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language
processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make
connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real
world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far
focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the
legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark
(CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether
executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate
governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate
governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world
corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set
of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task
is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent
with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following
established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate
governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters
selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life
corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models
confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents
exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct
frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the
advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the
benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current
reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning
capabilities of SOTA models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores whether large language model (LLM) agents can improve themselves in strategic planning tasks. The researchers used the board game Settlers of Catan to test progressively more advanced LLM agents, culminating in agents that could rewrite their own prompts and code. A multi-agent system was developed where different roles collaborated to analyze games, research strategies, and modify the agent's logic. Results showed that self-evolving agents outperformed static ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLM agents can self-improve in environments that challenge their strategic planning abilities.

Method: Using the board game Settlers of Catan through the Catanatron framework, the researchers benchmarked a progression of LLM-based agents, from simple game-playing agents to systems that could autonomously rewrite prompts and code. They introduced a multi-agent architecture with specialized roles for analysis, research, coding, and playing.

Result: Self-evolving agents, especially those powered by advanced models, outperformed static baselines by adapting strategies, passing on behaviors, and demonstrating adaptive reasoning over iterations.

Conclusion: LLM agents can self-improve in strategic planning tasks when placed in challenging environments, particularly when using advanced models.

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enabled their use as autonomous agents across a
range of tasks, yet they continue to struggle with formulating and adhering to
coherent long-term strategies. In this paper, we investigate whether LLM agents
can self-improve when placed in environments that explicitly challenge their
strategic planning abilities. Using the board game Settlers of Catan, accessed
through the open-source Catanatron framework, we benchmark a progression of
LLM-based agents, from a simple game-playing agent to systems capable of
autonomously rewriting their own prompts and their player agent's code. We
introduce a multi-agent architecture in which specialized roles (Analyzer,
Researcher, Coder, and Player) collaborate to iteratively analyze gameplay,
research new strategies, and modify the agent's logic or prompt. By comparing
manually crafted agents to those evolved entirely by LLMs, we evaluate how
effectively these systems can diagnose failure and adapt over time. Our results
show that self-evolving agents, particularly when powered by models like Claude
3.7 and GPT-4o, outperform static baselines by autonomously adopting their
strategies, passing along sample behavior to game-playing agents, and
demonstrating adaptive reasoning over multiple iterations.

Conclusion: 研究展示了使用大型语言模型从非结构化数据中提取关键安全变量的潜力。所提出的方法为提高电动自行车事故分析的准确性和提供政策制定者、设计师和监管者的可操作信息提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Electric bicycles (e-bikes) are rapidly increasing in use, raising safety
concerns due to a rise in accident reports. However, e-bike incident reports
often use unstructured narrative formats, which hinders quantitative safety
analysis. This study introduces E-bike agents, a framework that uses large
language models (LLM) powered agents to classify and extract safety variables
from unstructured incident reports. Our framework consists of four LLM agents,
handling data classification, information extraction, injury cause
determination, and component linkage, to extract the key factors that could
lead to E-bike accidents and cause varying severity levels. Furthermore, we
used an ordered logit model to examine the relationship between the severity of
the incident and the factors retrieved, such as gender, the type of cause, and
environmental conditions. Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly
more common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often
fatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to
accidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in
classification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract
unstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation. Our method offers a
scalable solution to improve e-bike safety analytics and provides actionable
information for policy makers, designers, and regulators.

Abstract: Within the domain of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) economy research,
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged as a robust tool for analyzing game
economics, evolving from rule-based agents to decision-making agents enhanced

challenges when attempting to emulate human-like economic activities among

interpretability. In this study, we take a preliminary step in introducing a
novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) in MMO economy simulation.
Leveraging LLMs' role-playing proficiency, generative capacity, and reasoning
aptitude, we design LLM-driven agents with human-like decision-making and
adaptability. These agents are equipped with the abilities of role-playing,
perception, memory, and reasoning, addressing the aforementioned challenges
effectively. Simulation experiments focusing on in-game economic activities
demonstrate that LLM-empowered agents can promote emergent phenomena like role

TL;DR: This paper presents a fine-grained analytic framework to understand the advantages of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities. It investigates how RL impacts plan-following, problem decomposition, and reasoning/knowledge utilization. Key findings include degraded performance on complex tasks when providing explicit plans, but increased robustness and better internal strategy formulation. RL also improves knowledge integration into reasoning, leading to performance gains across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a granular understanding of the advantages of RL-based training methods in language models' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained analytic framework to investigate the impact of RL on specific aspects of reasoning: plan-following and execution, problem decomposition, and improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.

Result: Models tuned with RL show greater robustness and smaller performance drops on challenging benchmarks. Providing explicit plans degrades performance, suggesting RL doesn't enhance external plan execution but improves internal strategy formulation. RL also enhances knowledge integration into reasoning, improving performance across tasks. Developing new ways to exploit hard problems leads to improved training.

Conclusion: The findings provide a foundation for more principled training and evaluation of reasoning models by understanding the specific benefits of RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become the dominant paradigm for endowing
language models with advanced reasoning capabilities. Despite the substantial
empirical gains demonstrated by RL-based training methods like GRPO, a granular
understanding of their advantages is still lacking. To address this gap, we
introduce a fine-grained analytic framework to dissect the impact of RL on
reasoning. Our framework specifically investigates key elements that have been
hypothesized to benefit from RL training: (1) plan-following and execution, (2)
problem decomposition, and (3) improved reasoning and knowledge utilization.
Using this framework, we gain insights beyond mere accuracy. For instance,
providing models with explicit step-by-step plans surprisingly degrades
performance on the most challenging benchmarks, yet RL-tuned models exhibit
greater robustness, experiencing markedly smaller performance drops than their
base counterparts. This suggests that RL may not primarily enhance the
execution of external plans but rather empower models to formulate and follow
internal strategies better suited to their reasoning processes. Conversely, we
observe that RL enhances the model's capacity to integrate provided knowledge
into its reasoning process, leading to performance improvements across diverse
tasks. We also study difficulty, showing improved training by developing new
ways to exploit hard problems. Our findings lay a foundation for more
principled training and evaluation of reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been

mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study
reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant

observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the
Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their
claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we
advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model

segmentation-classification tasks, incorporating Visual Language Models (VLMs)
through prompts, (2) an ontology-enhanced Visual Question Answering (VQA)
system for clinical reasoning, and (3) a multimodal deep learning model that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safety and reliability in real-world reinforcement learning applications with strict constraints on agent behavior.

Method: Jointly optimizing task performance and safety using an adaptive mechanism that switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution, resolving the objective mismatch problem and employing dynamic safety thresholds.

Result: Significant improvements over non-adaptive methods in experiments, demonstrating simultaneous optimization of safety and performance on diverse safety-critical continuous control tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves robust performance in safety-critical tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) applications in real-world scenarios must
prioritize safety and reliability, which impose strict constraints on agent
behavior. Model-based RL leverages predictive world models for action planning
and policy optimization, but inherent model inaccuracies can lead to
catastrophic failures in safety-critical settings. We propose a novel
model-based RL framework that jointly optimizes task performance and safety. To
address world model errors, our method incorporates an adaptive mechanism that
dynamically switches between model-based planning and direct policy execution.
We resolve the objective mismatch problem of traditional model-based approaches
using an implicit world model. Furthermore, our framework employs dynamic
safety thresholds that adapt to the agent's evolving capabilities, consistently
selecting actions that surpass safe policy suggestions in both performance and
safety. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over non-adaptive
methods, showing that our approach optimizes safety and performance
simultaneously rather than merely meeting minimum safety requirements. The
proposed framework achieves robust performance on diverse safety-critical
continuous control tasks, outperforming existing methods.

network reacts depending in a given state and what properties are to change.
Collective choice of the actions brings the whole environment closer or farther
from respective cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders goals. Using the simulator,
we implemented a realistically inspired scenario with several behavior
implementation approaches for cyber-defenders and cyber-attackers.

*Jônata Tyska Carvalho,Stefano Nolfi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel approach allowing large language models to control embodied agents by generating and refining strategies based on textual descriptions and performance feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling large language models to control embodied agents by mapping observation vectors to action vectors.

Method: LLMs generate a control strategy based on textual descriptions and refine it iteratively through learning with performance feedback and sensory-motor data.

Result: Successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions for classic control tasks from Gymnasium and MuJoCo libraries.

Conclusion: This method integrates symbolic knowledge with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data.

Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control
embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to
continuous action vectors. Initially, the LLMs generate a control strategy
based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended
goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in
which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using
performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation.
The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and
the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. In most cases, it
successfully identifies optimal or high-performing solutions by integrating
symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor
data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.

*Kai Wang,Yihao Zhang,Meng Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究了具有链式思维（CoT）推理能力的大语言模型的战略性欺骗问题，并提出方法来检测和控制这种欺骗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的诚实是一个关键的对齐挑战，尤其是当先进的系统具有链式思维（CoT）推理时可能会战略性地欺骗人类。与传统上LLMs上的诚实问题不同，这些问题可以被解释为某种幻觉，而这些模型的显式思维路径使我们能够研究战略性欺骗——目标驱动、有意的信息误导，其中推理与输出相矛盾。

Method: 使用表示工程来系统地诱导、检测和控制链式思维（CoT）支持的语言模型中的这种欺骗，提取'欺骗向量'，并通过线性人工断层扫描（LAT）实现89%的检测准确性。

Result: 我们通过线性人工断层扫描（LAT）提取了'欺骗向量'，实现了89%的检测准确率。通过激活引导，我们成功地在没有明确提示的情况下引发了上下文合适的欺骗，成功率达到了40%。

Conclusion: 通过激活引导，我们在引发适当的语境欺骗方面取得了40%的成功率，并揭示了推理模型的特定诚实相关问题，为值得信赖的人工智能对齐提供了工具。

Abstract: The honesty of large language models (LLMs) is a critical alignment
challenge, especially as advanced systems with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
may strategically deceive humans. Unlike traditional honesty issues on LLMs,
which could be possibly explained as some kind of hallucination, those models'
explicit thought paths enable us to study strategic deception--goal-driven,
intentional misinformation where reasoning contradicts outputs. Using
representation engineering, we systematically induce, detect, and control such
deception in CoT-enabled LLMs, extracting "deception vectors" via Linear
Artificial Tomography (LAT) for 89% detection accuracy. Through activation
steering, we achieve a 40% success rate in eliciting context-appropriate
deception without explicit prompts, unveiling the specific honesty-related
issue of reasoning models and providing tools for trustworthy AI alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA)，一种结合神经细胞自动机和不同iable逻辑门网络的方法，用于生成复杂的靶图案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在学习局部更新规则以生成所需的靶图案时面临挑战，尤其是当这些图案具有复杂性时。此外，在保持细胞自动机固有的离散特性的同时实现这一点也是一个难题。

Method: 提出了一种新型的神经细胞自动机（NCA）和不同iable逻辑门网络（DLGNs）组合——Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA)。该模型的基本计算单元是不同iable逻辑门，这些逻辑门被组合成一个电路。在训练过程中，该模型是完全端到端的不同iable，允许基于梯度的训练；而在推理时间，它在完全离散的状态空间中运行。

Result: 我们的方法展示了多种能力，包括完全学习康威生命游戏的规则，生成表现出对噪声和损坏具有弹性的棋盘图案，生长出蜥蜴形状以及多色图案生成。对于更简单的图案，无论是同步还是异步更新，我们都观察到了成功，并且表现出了显著的泛化能力和对扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们证明了这种不同iable逻辑门网络和神经细胞自动机的结合代表了向可编程物质和结合了二进制逻辑、神经网络适应性和局部处理的鲁棒计算系统的一步。据我们所知，这项工作首次成功地在循环架构中应用了不同iable逻辑门网络。

Abstract: This paper introduces Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata (DiffLogic CA),
a novel combination of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic
Gates Networks (DLGNs). The fundamental computation units of the model are
differentiable logic gates, combined into a circuit. During training, the model
is fully end-to-end differentiable allowing gradient-based training, and at
inference time it operates in a fully discrete state space. This enables
learning local update rules for cellular automata while preserving their
inherent discrete nature. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach
through a series of milestones: (1) fully learning the rules of Conway's Game
of Life, (2) generating checkerboard patterns that exhibit resilience to noise
and damage, (3) growing a lizard shape, and (4) multi-color pattern generation.
Our model successfully learns recurrent circuits capable of generating desired
target patterns. For simpler patterns, we observe success with both synchronous
and asynchronous updates, demonstrating significant generalization capabilities
and robustness to perturbations. We make the case that this combination of
DLGNs and NCA represents a step toward programmable matter and robust computing
systems that combine binary logic, neural network adaptability, and localized
processing. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first successful
application of differentiable logic gate networks in recurrent architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create autonomous agents that can sustain themselves under fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions without external supervision.

Method: Formalizes the principle via an energy-based utility function and viability-constrained survival horizon, proposing a modular architecture integrating energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into a closed-loop control system.

Result: Simulations demonstrate the emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical and architectural foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces Energentic Intelligence, a class of autonomous systems
defined not by task performance, but by their capacity to sustain themselves
through internal energy regulation. Departing from conventional reward-driven
paradigms, these agents treat survival-maintaining functional operation under
fluctuating energetic and thermal conditions-as the central objective. We
formalize this principle through an energy-based utility function and a
viability-constrained survival horizon, and propose a modular architecture that
integrates energy harvesting, thermal regulation, and adaptive computation into
a closed-loop control system. A simulated environment demonstrates the
emergence of stable, resource-aware behavior without external supervision.
Together, these contributions provide a theoretical and architectural
foundation for deploying autonomous agents in resource-volatile settings where
persistence must be self-regulated and infrastructure cannot be assumed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-UAV is a new method that helps LLMs solve math problems for UAV tasks better by using related documents. It improves the accuracy and reduces mistakes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional flight control uses hardcoded equations, but LLMs need help to correctly select and apply math formulations and do precise calculations for UAV tasks.

Method: RAG-UAV adds a retrieval feature to several LLMs to access UAV-related literature for better math reasoning.

Result: In tests, RAG-UAV improved exact answer accuracy to 75%, reduced wrong formulation choices from 25% to 5%, and greatly decreased numerical errors.

Conclusion: This study shows RAG can make LLMs more reliable for engineering analysis in UAVs, but more research is needed for real-time flight control.

Abstract: Autonomous UAV operation necessitates reliable mathematical reasoning for
tasks such as trajectory planning and power management. While traditional
flight control relies on hardcoded equations, recent Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer potential for more flexible problem-solving but struggle with
reliably selecting and applying correct mathematical formulations and executing
precise multi-step arithmetic. We propose RAG-UAV, a retrieval-augmented
generation framework designed to improve the mathematical reasoning of several
LLMs (including GPT o1/Turbo, Llama-3.2/3.3, Mistral, and DeepSeek R1) in
UAV-specific contexts by providing access to relevant domain literature. To
conduct an initial assessment, we introduce the UAV-Math-Bench, a small problem
set comprising 20 UAV-centric mathematical problems across four difficulty
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating retrieval substantially
increases exact answer accuracy (achieving up to 75% with o1), reduces
instances of incorrect formulation selection (from 25% without RAG to 5% with
RAG), decreases numerical errors, reducing Mean Squared Error (MSE) by orders
of magnitude for the best-performing models. This pilot study indicates that
RAG can enable general-purpose LLMs to function as more reliable tools for
engineering analysis, although direct real-time flight control requires further
investigation and validation on a larger scale. All benchmark data, question
and answer are publicly available.

### [127] [Truly Self-Improving Agents Require Intrinsic Metacognitive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05109)
*Tennison Liu,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-improving agents need intrinsic metacognitive learning to overcome limitations in rigidity, task generalization, and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-improving agents have limitations in rigidity, task generalization, and scalability.

Method: Introduce a formal framework with three components: metacognitive knowledge, planning, and evaluation.

Result: Found that existing agents rely on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, but many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are already present.

Conclusion: Key challenges include distributing metacognitive responsibilities and evaluating/improving intrinsic metacognitive learning to enable sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

Abstract: Self-improving agents aim to continuously acquire new capabilities with
minimal supervision. However, current approaches face two key limitations:
their self-improvement processes are often rigid, fail to generalize across
tasks domains, and struggle to scale with increasing agent capabilities. We
argue that effective self-improvement requires intrinsic metacognitive
learning, defined as an agent's intrinsic ability to actively evaluate, reflect
on, and adapt its own learning processes. Drawing inspiration from human
metacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:
metacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning
strategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and
metacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future
learning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely
predominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,
human-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability. Examining each
component, we contend that many ingredients for intrinsic metacognition are
already present. Finally, we explore how to optimally distribute metacognitive
responsibilities between humans and agents, and robustly evaluate and improve
intrinsic metacognitive learning, key challenges that must be addressed to
enable truly sustained, generalized, and aligned self-improvement.

*Nathan Herr,Tim Rocktäschel,Roberta Raileanu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: We introduced LFS, a new approach that enables large language models to autonomously guide the search process, showing better performance and efficiency on reasoning tasks like Countdown and Sudoku.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on fixed exploration hyperparameters, limiting their adaptability across tasks of varying difficulty. They can be impractical or expensive in certain settings.

Method: LLM-First Search (LFS)

Result: LFS outperforms other methods on more challenging tasks without additional tuning, is more computationally efficient, scales better with stronger models, and scales better with increased compute budget.

Conclusion: We proposed LFS, a novel LLM Self-Guided Search method that allows the LLM to autonomously control the search process.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Adaptive Length Penalty (ALP) to adjust generation length based on per-prompt solve rate, improving efficiency without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reducing token usage in LRMs either require significant data curation, manual configuration, or treat all problems equally regardless of difficulty.

Method: Reinforcement learning objective that adds a differentiable penalty scaling inversely with online solve rate during training.

Result: Posttraining DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP reduces average token usage by 50% without significantly dropping performance.

Conclusion: ALP improves efficiency by redistributing reduced budget more intelligently, achieving higher accuracy on hard problems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher performance on challenging
reasoning tasks by generating more tokens at inference time, but this verbosity
often wastes computation on easy problems. Existing solutions, including
supervised finetuning on shorter traces, user-controlled budgets, or RL with
uniform penalties, either require data curation, manual configuration, or treat
all problems alike regardless of difficulty. We introduce Adaptive Length
Penalty (ALP), a reinforcement learning objective tailoring generation length
to per-prompt solve rate. During training, ALP monitors each prompt's online
solve rate through multiple rollouts and adds a differentiable penalty whose
magnitude scales inversely with that rate, so confident (easy) prompts incur a
high cost for extra tokens while hard prompts remain unhindered. Posttraining
DeepScaleR-1.5B with ALP cuts average token usage by 50\% without significantly
dropping performance. Relative to fixed-budget and uniform penalty baselines,
ALP redistributes its reduced budget more intelligently by cutting compute on
easy prompts and reallocating saved tokens to difficult ones, delivering higher
accuracy on the hardest problems with higher cost.

Abstract: The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instilling greater trust among diverse stakeholders in sensitive domains

Method: Aggregating commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms

Result: Examining recent advances in improving the reliability of Concept-based Models and discussing open problems and future research avenues

Conclusion: Identifying the risks and limitations of Concept-based Models and suggesting ways to improve their reliability

Abstract: Concept-based Models are a class of inherently explainable networks that
improve upon standard Deep Neural Networks by providing a rationale behind
their predictions using human-understandable `concepts'. With these models
being highly successful in critical applications like medical diagnosis and
financial risk prediction, there is a natural push toward their wider adoption
in sensitive domains to instill greater trust among diverse stakeholders.
However, recent research has uncovered significant limitations in the structure
of such networks, their training procedure, underlying assumptions, and their
susceptibility to adversarial vulnerabilities. In particular, issues such as
concept leakage, entangled representations, and limited robustness to
perturbations pose challenges to their reliability and generalization.
Additionally, the effectiveness of human interventions in these models remains
an open question, raising concerns about their real-world applicability. In
this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the risks and limitations
associated with Concept-based Models. In particular, we focus on aggregating
commonly encountered challenges and the architecture choices mitigating these
challenges for Supervised and Unsupervised paradigms. We also examine recent
advances in improving their reliability and discuss open problems and promising
avenues of future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in open-world scenarios requires effective OOD detection.

Method: Augmenting OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning using MLNs and introducing an algorithm to learn logical constraints from data.

Result: MLNs significantly improve the performance of various existing OOD detectors without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Integrating probabilistic reasoning via MLNs can enhance the reliability and explainability of OOD detection systems.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models operating in open-world scenarios. Current OOD
detectors mainly rely on statistical models to identify unusual patterns in the
latent representations of a deep neural network. This work proposes to augment
existing OOD detectors with probabilistic reasoning, utilizing Markov logic
networks (MLNs). MLNs connect first-order logic with probabilistic reasoning to
assign probabilities to inputs based on weighted logical constraints defined
over human-understandable concepts, which offers improved explainability.
Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that MLNs
can significantly enhance the performance of a wide range of existing OOD
detectors while maintaining computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce
a simple algorithm for learning logical constraints for OOD detection from a
dataset and showcase its effectiveness.

*Warayut Dokduea,Weerachart Tangchirapat,Sompote Youwai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new architecture called the Triple Attention Transformer to predict concrete creep over time. It performs significantly better than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches do not effectively model the sequential nature of concrete creep over time.

Method: The architecture uses three types of attention mechanisms (temporal, feature, and batch) within a transformer model to predict creep as a sequence.

Result: It achieved very high accuracy (MAPE of 1.63%, R2 of 0.999) across multiple datasets compared to traditional models.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures can be successfully applied to materials science problems like predicting structural behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Triple Attention Transformer Architecture for
predicting time-dependent concrete creep, addressing fundamental limitations in
current approaches that treat time as merely an input parameter rather than
modeling the sequential nature of deformation development. By transforming
concrete creep prediction into an autoregressive sequence modeling task similar
to language processing, our architecture leverages the transformer's
self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in historical
creep patterns. The model implements a triple-stream attention framework
incorporating temporal attention for sequential progression, feature attention
for material property interactions, and batch attention for inter-sample
relationships. Evaluated on experimental datasets with standardized daily
measurements spanning 160 days, the architecture achieves exceptional
performance with mean absolute percentage error of 1.63% and R2 values of 0.999
across all datasets, substantially outperforming traditional empirical models
and existing machine learning approaches. Ablation studies confirm the critical
role of attention mechanisms, with attention pooling contributing most
significantly to model performance. SHAP analysis reveals Young's modulus as
the primary predictive feature, followed by density and compressive strength,
providing interpretability essential for engineering applications. A deployed
web-based interface facilitates practical implementation, enabling real-time
predictions using standard laboratory parameters. This work establishes the
viability of applying transformer architectures to materials science problems,
demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to revolutionize
structural behavior prediction and engineering design practices.

Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for evolving safety policies is costly and impractical, and current mechanistic interpretability methods have untapped potential for precise safety adjustments.

Method: SafeSteer uses category-specific steering vectors, a gradient-free unsupervised method, and does not require contrastive pairwise safe data.

Result: The method demonstrates effectiveness across various LLMs, datasets, and risk categories, providing precise control, preventing blanket refusals, and maintaining topic relevance.

Conclusion: Simple techniques like SafeSteer can outperform complex ones in activation steering for guiding LLM outputs towards safer content.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving safety policies
is costly and impractical. Mechanistic interpretability enables inference-time
control through latent activation steering, yet its potential for precise,
customizable safety adjustments remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates an approach called SafeSteer for guiding the outputs of LLMs by:
(i) leveraging category-specific steering vectors for more precise control,
(ii) employing a simple, gradient-free unsupervised method to enhance safety
steering while preserving text quality, topic relevance, and without explicit
refusal, and (iii) accomplishing this without a hard requirement of contrastive
pairwise safe data. We also highlight that our method, being simple and
effective, aligns with recent studies suggesting that simple techniques often
outperform more complex ones in activation steering. We showcase the
effectiveness of our approach across various LLMs, datasets, and risk
categories, demonstrating its ability to provide precise control, prevent
blanket refusals, and guide models toward generating safe content while

Abstract: Forest fire prediction involves estimating the likelihood of fire ignition or
related risk levels in a specific area over a defined time period. With climate
change intensifying fire behavior and frequency, accurate prediction has become
one of the most pressing challenges in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Traditionally, fire ignition is approached as a binary classification task in
the literature. However, this formulation oversimplifies the problem,
especially from the perspective of end-users such as firefighters. In general,
as is the case in France, firefighting units are organized by department, each
with its terrain, climate conditions, and historical experience with fire
events. Consequently, fire risk should be modeled in a way that is sensitive to
local conditions and does not assume uniform risk across all regions. This
paper proposes a new approach that tailors fire risk assessment to departmental
contexts, offering more actionable and region-specific predictions for
operational use. With this, we present the first national-scale AI benchmark
for metropolitan France using state-of-the-art AI models on a relatively
unexplored dataset. Finally, we offer a summary of important future works that
should be taken into account. Supplementary materials are available on GitHub.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MUC-G4, a new framework for verifying compressed deep neural networks by using Minimal Unsat Cores (MUCs) to guide efficient verification, showing better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying neural networks on edge devices is challenging due to their high memory and runtime complexity. Existing incremental verification methods focus only on quantization and struggle with structural changes.

Method: MUC-G4 encodes both original and compressed networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and uses MUCs from the original network to guide efficient verification for the compressed network.

Result: Experimental results show that MUC-G4 is effective in handling quantization and pruning, with high proof reuse rates and significant speedup in verification time compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: MUC-G4 offers a promising solution for ensuring the safety and reliability of compressed neural networks in practical applications.

Abstract: The rapid development of deep learning has led to challenges in deploying
neural networks on edge devices, mainly due to their high memory and runtime
complexity. Network compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning,
aim to reduce this complexity while maintaining accuracy. However, existing
incremental verification methods often focus only on quantization and struggle
with structural changes. This paper presents MUC-G4 (Minimal Unsat Core-Guided
Incremental Verification), a novel framework for incremental verification of
compressed deep neural networks. It encodes both the original and compressed
networks into SMT formulas, classifies changes, and use \emph{Minimal Unsat
Cores (MUCs)} from the original network to guide efficient verification for the
compressed network. Experimental results show its effectiveness in handling

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of the sampling distribution on DPO's training dynamics.

Method: Analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient descent, design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop quantitative results.

Result: More frequent high-quality responses amplify the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more effective policy learning.

Conclusion: Both the solution space and the convergence behavior of DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution.

Abstract: We study the role of the sampling distribution in Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and aim to understand its impact on DPO's training dynamics.
Our analyses show that both the solution space and the convergence behavior of
DPO depend on the support and quality of the generating distribution. We first
analyze how distribution of responses influences policy updates during gradient
descent, drawing connections to common phenomena found in practice. We then
design a simplified yet well-structured alignment model as a proxy, and develop
quantitative results showing how more frequent high-quality responses amplify
the gradient signal and improve the optimization landscape, leading to more
effective policy learning. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments and provide a principled justification for the online DPO framework
in practice.

*Xu Zheng,Chaohao Lin,Sipeng Chen,Zhuomin Chen,Jimeng Shi,Wei Cheng,Jayantha Obeysekera,Jason Liu,Dongsheng Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces SF2Bench, a comprehensive dataset for analyzing compound floods in South Florida by integrating tide, rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities. It evaluates six types of machine learning models to forecast compound floods, examining the impact of different features and the importance of historical data and spatial dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing flood risks due to global climate change make it necessary to improve flood forecasting. Traditional methods are inefficient, while machine learning shows promise but lacks sufficient data.

Method: SF2Bench is created by combining four key factors related to compound floods. Six categories of machine learning models are evaluated for their performance in forecasting floods.

Result: Experiments show that different models perform differently, indicating their varying abilities in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies in compound floods.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into using machine learning for compound flood forecasting and highlights the need for further development of large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Forecasting compound floods presents a significant challenge due to the
intricate interplay of meteorological, hydrological, and oceanographic factors.
Analyzing compound floods has become more critical as the global climate
increases flood risks. Traditional physics-based methods, such as the
Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, are often
time-inefficient. Machine learning has recently demonstrated promise in both
modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. However, the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets currently hinders systematic analysis. Existing
water-related datasets are often limited by a sparse network of monitoring
stations and incomplete coverage of relevant factors. To address this
challenge, we introduce SF2Bench, a comprehensive time series collection on
compound floods in South Florida, which integrates four key factors: tide,
rainfall, groundwater, and human management activities (gate and pump
controlling). This integration allows for a more detailed analysis of the
individual contributions of these drivers to compound flooding and informs the
development of improved flood forecasting approaches. To comprehensively
evaluate the potential of various modeling paradigms, we assess the performance
of six categories of methods, encompassing Multilayer Perceptrons,
Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Graph Neural
Networks, Transformers, and Large Language Models. We verified the impact of
different key features on flood forecasting through experiments. Our analysis
examines temporal and spatial aspects, providing insights into the influence of
historical data and spatial dependencies. The varying performance across these
approaches underscores the diverse capabilities of each in capturing complex
temporal and spatial dependencies inherent in compound floods.

*Dravyansh Sharma,Alec Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores the learnability with improvements in machine learning algorithms, introducing an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and providing positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the learnability of machine learning algorithms when agents genuinely improve to achieve desirable classification.

Method: Introducing an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and studying learnability under Euclidean ball improvement sets.

Result: Exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting, positive results for improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution, and achievement of lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning.

Conclusion: The paper resolves open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.

Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example
in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly
important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning
algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has
focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified
agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of
learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable
classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard
PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with
improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of
minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact
characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable
setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary
agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean
ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a
mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to
learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under
well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable
and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al.
for both proper and improper learning.

*Runxiang Wang,Boxiao Wang,Kai Li,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DrSR combines data-driven insights with reflective learning to improve symbolic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches lack explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during equation generation.

Method: DrSR uses dual reasoning to guide LLMs in analyzing data structures and establishing a feedback loop to refine equations.

Result: DrSR shows improved valid equation rates and outperforms other methods in interdisciplinary datasets.

Conclusion: DrSR enhances both robustness and discovery capability in symbolic regression.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is a fundamental tool for discovering interpretable
mathematical expressions from data, with broad applications across scientific
and engineering domains. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance in this task, leveraging embedded scientific
priors and reasoning capabilities to surpass traditional methods. However,
existing LLM-based approaches, such as LLM-SR, often over-rely on internal
priors, lacking explicit data understanding and systematic reflection during
equation generation. To address these limitations, we propose DrSR (Dual
Reasoning Symbolic Regression), a framework that combines data-driven insight
with reflective learning to enhance both robustness and discovery capability.
Specifically, DrSR guides LLMs to analyze structural relationships (e.g.,
monotonicity, nonlinearity, and correlation) within the data to generate
structured descriptions. Simultaneously, it monitors equation performance and
establishes a feedback loop to refine subsequent generations. By integrating
data understanding and generation reflection in a closed loop, DrSR enables
more efficient exploration of the symbolic expression space. Experiments across
interdisciplinary datasets in physics, chemistry, biology, and materials
science demonstrate that DrSR substantially improves the valid equation rate
and consistently outperforms both classical and recent LLM-based methods in
terms of accuracy, generalization, and search efficiency. These results
underscore its potential for scientific equation discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) processes multi-spectral satellite images to detect changes caused by natural disasters and prioritize relevant data for downlinking, achieving comparable or better results than a state-of-the-art AI model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The bottleneck in bandwidth-limited downlinking of data from satellites to ground stations requires processing some data onboard to prioritize pertinent data.

Method: The PANN uses nano-electronic circuit elements called 'memristors' to generate physics-constrained dynamical output features for detecting changes in natural disasters.

Result: The PANN performed comparably or better than a state-of-the-art AI model in each natural disaster category.

Conclusion: The PANN provides a promising solution for resource-constrained on-board processing of satellite data for natural disaster detection.

Abstract: Earth observations from low Earth orbit satellites provide vital information
for decision makers to better manage time-sensitive events such as natural
disasters. For the data to be most effective for first responders, low latency
is required between data capture and its arrival to decision makers. A major
bottleneck is in the bandwidth-limited downlinking of the data from satellites
to ground stations. One approach to overcome this challenge is to process at
least some of the data on-board and prioritise pertinent data to be downlinked.
In this work we propose a Physics Aware Neuromorphic Network (PANN) to detect
changes caused by natural disasters from a sequence of multi-spectral satellite
images and produce a change map, enabling relevant data to be prioritised for
downlinking. The PANN used in this study is motivated by physical neural
networks comprised of nano-electronic circuit elements known as "memristors"
(nonlinear resistors with memory). The weights in the network are dynamic and
update in response to varying input signals according to memristor equations of
state and electrical circuit conservation laws. The PANN thus generates
physics-constrained dynamical output features which are used to detect changes
in a natural disaster detection task by applying a distance-based metric.
Importantly, this makes the whole model training-free, allowing it to be
implemented with minimal computing resources. The PANN was benchmarked against
a state-of-the-art AI model and achieved comparable or better results in each
natural disaster category. It thus presents a promising solution to the
challenge of resource-constrained on-board processing.

TL;DR: BAT uses backbone data to improve adaptation data-limited tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in training large backbone models.

Method: Backbone Augmented Training (BAT) and ALBAT algorithm are proposed to leverage backbone data for adaptation.

Result: ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

Conclusion: BAT is a promising method to address the challenge of limited adaptation data.

Abstract: Adaptations facilitate efficient training of large backbone models, including
diffusion models for image generation and transformer-based language models.
While various adaptation techniques enhance performance with minimal
computational resources, limited adaptation data often leads to challenges in
training. To address this, we focus on the enormous amount of backbone data
used to pre-train the backbone models. We propose Backbone Augmented Training
(BAT), a method that leverages backbone data to augment the adaptation dataset.
First, we formulate and prove two mathematical key propositions: one
establishes the validity of BAT, while the other identifies a condition under
which BAT benefits adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce an advanced data
selection scheme that satisfies these propositions and present ALBAT algorithm
to implement this approach. ALBAT efficiently enhances adaptation training in
both personalization and language generation tasks with scarce data.

### [143] [Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers trained on a transitive inference task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289)
*Jesse Geerts,Stephanie Chan,Claudia Clopath,Kimberly Stachenfeld*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based models excel in relational reasoning through different learning regimes. In-weights learning shows a natural bias for transitive inference, while in-context learning models trained only on adjacent items fail to generalize transitively. Pre-training on structured tasks helps in-context transformers mimic symbolic distance and terminal item effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in transformer-based models under in-weights learning and in-context learning regimes.

Method: Comparing transitive inference behaviors across in-weights learning and in-context learning regimes, and analyzing the development of induction circuits in models.

Result: In-weights learning naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference, whereas in-context learning models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively. Pre-training on structured tasks improves in-context relational reasoning.

Conclusion: Pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities,
but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning in different learning
regimes remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate how transformers
perform a classic relational reasoning task from the Psychology literature,
\textit{transitive inference}, which requires inference about indirectly
related items by integrating information across observed adjacent item pairs
(e.g., if A>B and B>C, then A>C). We compare transitive inference behavior
across two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models
store information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where
models flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our
findings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards
transitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL
models trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.
Mechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that
implement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating
adjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among
indirectly related items. Interestingly, when pre-trained on in-context linear
regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable
transitive inference. Moreover, like IWL, they display both \textit{symbolic
distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal
performance, without forming induction circuits. These results suggest that
pre-training on tasks with underlying structure promotes the development of
representations that can scaffold in-context relational reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new algorithm called LDPTRLQ which combines the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty method with reinforcement learning to address complex optimization challenges in IoT devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of optimization challenges in IoT devices requires a more effective approach than current methods.

Method: The authors derived an effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.

Result: Simulation results show that LDPTRLQ outperforms baseline methods in terms of compatibility and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed LDPTRLQ algorithm offers theoretical superiority and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, the demand for
addressing complex optimization challenges has intensified. The Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm is a widely adopted approach for ensuring queue
stability, and some research has preliminarily explored its integration with
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate the adaptation of
the Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty algorithm for RL applications, deriving an
effective method for combining Lyapunov Drift-Plus-Penalty with RL under a set
of common and reasonable conditions through rigorous theoretical analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that directly merge the two frameworks, our proposed
algorithm, termed Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method tailored for reinforcement
learning with queue stability (LDPTRLQ) algorithm, offers theoretical
superiority by effectively balancing the greedy optimization of Lyapunov
Drift-Plus-Penalty with the long-term perspective of RL. Simulation results for
multiple problems demonstrate that LDPTRLQ outperforms the baseline methods
using the Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty method and RL, corroborating the validity
of our theoretical derivations. The results also demonstrate that our proposed
algorithm outperforms other benchmarks in terms of compatibility and stability.

TL;DR: AutoCT is a novel framework that combines large language models and classical machine learning to predict clinical trial outcomes accurately, autonomously generating and refining tabular features for improved interpretability and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical trials are costly and time-consuming; accurate prediction can reduce costs and accelerate drug discovery; existing deep learning models have limitations like lack of interpretability and vulnerability to label leakage.

Method: Combining large language models' reasoning capabilities with classical machine learning's explainability; using Monte Carlo Tree Search for optimization; no human input required.

Result: Performs on par with or better than state-of-the-art methods on clinical trial prediction tasks within limited self-refinement iterations.

Conclusion: AutoCT establishes a new paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial prediction.

Abstract: Clinical trials are critical for advancing medical treatments but remain
prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accurate prediction of clinical
trial outcomes can significantly reduce research and development costs and
accelerate drug discovery. While recent deep learning models have shown promise
by leveraging unstructured data, their black-box nature, lack of
interpretability, and vulnerability to label leakage limit their practical use
in high-stakes biomedical contexts. In this work, we propose AutoCT, a novel
framework that combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models
with the explainability of classical machine learning. AutoCT autonomously
generates, evaluates, and refines tabular features based on public information
without human input. Our method uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to iteratively
optimize predictive performance. Experimental results show that AutoCT performs
on par with or better than SOTA methods on clinical trial prediction tasks
within only a limited number of self-refinement iterations, establishing a new
paradigm for scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient clinical trial
prediction.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines real-world data with synthetic mechanical breakdown scenarios to improve short-term hauling-fleet capacity forecasting in open-pit mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in open-pit mining due to operational uncertainties caused by weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and variable crew availability.

Method: A deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records with synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios.

Result: An XGBoost regressor achieved a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent and a Long Short-Term Memory network had a MedAE of 15.1 per cent.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that integrating simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features notably reduces prediction volatility.

Abstract: Accurate short-term forecasting of hauling-fleet capacity is crucial in
open-pit mining, where weather fluctuations, mechanical breakdowns, and
variable crew availability introduce significant operational uncertainties. We
propose a deep-learning framework that blends real-world operational records
(high-resolution rainfall measurements, fleet performance telemetry) with
synthetically generated mechanical-breakdown scenarios to enable the model to
capture fluctuating high-impact failure events. We evaluate two architectures:
an XGBoost regressor achieving a median absolute error (MedAE) of 14.3 per cent
and a Long Short-Term Memory network with a MedAE of 15.1 per cent. Shapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analyses identify cumulative rainfall,
historical payload trends, and simulated breakdown frequencies as dominant
predictors. Integration of simulated breakdown data and shift-planning features
notably reduces prediction volatility. Future work will further integrate
maintenance-scheduling indicators (Mean Time Between Failures, Mean Time to
Repair), detailed human resource data (operator absenteeism, crew efficiency
metrics), blast event scheduling, and other operational constraints to enhance
forecast robustness and adaptability. This hybrid modelling approach offers a
comprehensive decision-support tool for proactive, data-driven fleet management
under dynamically uncertain conditions.

TL;DR: This paper presents a 4-step process demonstrating how softlog-softmax cascades can enhance the consistency and reliability of ensemble learning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show the benefits of using softlog-softmax cascades in improving ensemble learning systems' consistency and dependability.

Method: Anatomical and physiological processes involving neural engineering and information theory are used to derive softlogs and propose new information measures.

Result: The proposed methods showed that ensemble diversity is more useful for complex problems and led to consistent intermediate decisions.

Conclusion: A performance tensor was derived for reliable ensemble evaluation.

Abstract: The paper proposes a 4-step process for highlighting that softlog-softmax
cascades can improve both consistency and dependability of the next generation
ensemble learning systems. The first process is anatomical in nature: the
target ensemble model under consideration is composed by canonical elements
relating to the definition of a convolutional frustum. No a priori is
considered in the choice of canonical forms. Diversity is the main criterion
for selecting these forms. It is shown that the more complex the problem, the
more useful this ensemble diversity is. The second process is physiological and
relates to neural engineering: a softlog is derived to both make weak
logarithmic operations consistent and lead, through multiple softlog-softmax
layers, to intermediate decisions in the sense of respecting the same class
logic as that faced by the output layer. The third process concerns neural
information theory: softlog-based entropy and divergence are proposed for the
sake of constructing information measures yielding consistent values on closed
intervals. These information measures are used to determine the relationships
between individual and sub-community decisions in frustum diversitybased
ensemble learning. The concluding process addresses the derivation of an
informative performance tensor for the purpose of a reliable ensemble
evaluation.

Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM)-based AI agents have recently showcased impressive
versatility by employing dynamic reasoning, an adaptive, multi-step process
that coordinates with external tools. This shift from static, single-turn
inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and
behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about
system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the
first comprehensive system-level analysis of AI agents, quantifying their
resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power
consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling
strategies. We further characterize how AI agent design choices, such as
few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact
accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy
with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening
latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed
evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational
demands introduced by AI agent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability
crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward
compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under
real-world constraints.

TL;DR: This paper introduces RedRFT, a lightweight benchmark for RFT-based red teaming of large language models. It standardizes implementation and evaluation, includes modular components, and provides an ablation study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified benchmark for RFT-based red teaming methods limits reproducibility and comparison.

Method: RedRFT is introduced, combining elements from CleanRL and Tianshou, with modular PPO components and support for various diversity metrics.

Result: RedRFT standardizes RFT-based red teaming, facilitates experimentation, and clarifies the impact of key components through ablation studies.

Conclusion: This work aims to enhance understanding of RFT-based red teaming implementation details and enable rapid prototyping of new features.

Abstract: Red teaming has proven to be an effective method for identifying and
mitigating vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy among existing red
teaming techniques. However, a lack of a unified benchmark hinders current
RFT-based red teaming methods. Implementation details, especially in Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO)-based RFT, significantly affect outcome stability and
reproducibility. To address this issue, we introduce RedRFT, a lightweight
benchmark designed to simplify and standardize the implementation and
evaluation of RFT-based red teaming. RedRFT combines the design strengths of
both single-file CleanRL and highly modularized Tianshou, offering high-quality
single-file red teaming implementations and modular PPO core components, such
as the General Advantage Estimator. It supports a variety of token and sentence
diversity metrics, featuring modularized intrinsic reward computation that
facilitates plug-and-play experimentation. To clarify their influence on RFT
performance, we conducted an extensive ablation study on key components,
including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and
Lagrange Multiplier. We hope this work contributes to 1) gaining a
comprehensive understanding of the implementation nuances of RFT-based red
teaming algorithms, and 2) enabling rapid prototyping of innovative features

TL;DR: A new method called You Only Train Once (YOTO) optimizes loss weights in one training session for better performance in computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of training runs required for optimizing loss weights in machine learning models.

Method: Automatically optimize loss weight hyperparameters using gradient-based optimization by treating them as regular network parameters.

Result: YOTO outperforms grid search methods in 3D estimation and semantic segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: YOTO provides an efficient way to optimize loss weights in one training session, improving performance in various computer vision tasks.

Abstract: The title of this paper is perhaps an overclaim. Of course, the process of
creating and optimizing a learned model inevitably involves multiple training
runs which potentially feature different architectural designs, input and
output encodings, and losses. However, our method, You Only Train Once (YOTO),
indeed contributes to limiting training to one shot for the latter aspect of
losses selection and weighting. We achieve this by automatically optimizing
loss weight hyperparameters of learned models in one shot via standard
gradient-based optimization, treating these hyperparameters as regular
parameters of the networks and learning them. To this end, we leverage the
differentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for
optimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel
layer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the
inherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding
degenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization
scheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,
which models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring
boundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in
jointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one
shot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across
state-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D
estimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently
outperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data. Code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a 'half' layer of hidden units with fixed random weights and modifiable weights for deep networks, demonstrating improved accuracy with fewer parameters on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of parameters in deep networks while maintaining or improving accuracy by introducing a new type of hidden unit with fixed random weights.

Method: Introduce 'half' units which have fixed random weights and only two modifiable weights per unit, allowing them to be used in any layer of a deep network.

Result: Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets showed that the use of 'half' layers could achieve reasonable accuracy with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed 'half' layer can effectively reduce the number of parameters in deep networks, demonstrating potential for more efficient neural network architectures.

Abstract: We propose a ``half'' layer of hidden units that has some of its weights
randomly set and some of them trained. A half unit is composed of two stages:
First, it takes a weighted sum of its inputs with fixed random weights, and
second, the total activation is multiplied and then translated using two
modifiable weights, before the result is passed through a nonlinearity. The
number of modifiable weights of each hidden unit is thus two and does not
depend on the fan-in. We show how such half units can be used in the first or
any later layer in a deep network, possibly following convolutional layers. Our
experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST data sets indicate the promise of half
layers, where we can achieve reasonable accuracy with a reduced number of
parameters due to the regularizing effect of the randomized connections.

*Philippe Chlenski,Itsik Pe'er*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a new way to express the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to extend the decision trees and models that use them as primitives to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space.

Method: The paper re-expresses the hyperDT algorithm in the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces, which allows it to be used as a wrapper around existing tree-based models in Euclidean spaces.

Result: The result of this paper is an improved version of the hyperDT algorithm that can be used in hyperbolic spaces with better performance.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new way to express the hyperDT algorithm using the Beltrami-Klein model. This method allows the existing tree-based models in Euclidean spaces to be used in hyperbolic spaces with improved flexibility, speed, and accuracy.

Abstract: Decision trees and models that use them as primitives are workhorses of
machine learning in Euclidean spaces. Recent work has further extended these
models to the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space by replacing axis-parallel
hyperplanes with homogeneous hyperplanes when partitioning the input space. In
this paper, we show how the hyperDT algorithm can be elegantly reexpressed in
the Beltrami-Klein model of hyperbolic spaces. This preserves the thresholding
operation used in Euclidean decision trees, enabling us to further rewrite
hyperDT as simple pre- and post-processing steps that form a wrapper around
existing tree-based models designed for Euclidean spaces. The wrapper approach
unlocks many optimizations already available in Euclidean space models,
improving flexibility, speed, and accuracy while offering a simpler, more
maintainable, and extensible codebase. Our implementation is available at

Motivation: 解决连续学习中的关键挑战——遗忘问题，特别是使用样本重放技术来减轻遗忘。

Method: 理论分析过参数化连续线性回归设置中的样本重放技术，并通过实验验证神经网络的表现。

Result: 在某些情况下，样本重放可能会有害，特别是在最坏情况设定和分布设定下。

Conclusion: 发现即使在无噪声的情况下，遗忘与重放样本数量之间的关系也可能非单调；即使在看似有利的情境下，重放性能也高度依赖于重放样本的选择和任务之间的关系。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks to enable machine learning systems to solve an
increasing corpus of tasks sequentially. A critical challenge for continual
learning is forgetting, where the performance on previously learned tasks
decreases as new tasks are introduced. One of the commonly used techniques to
mitigate forgetting, sample replay, has been shown empirically to reduce
forgetting by retaining some examples from old tasks and including them in new
training episodes. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of sample
replay in an over-parameterized continual linear regression setting, where each
task is given by a linear subspace and with enough replay samples, one would be
able to eliminate forgetting. Our analysis focuses on sample replay and
highlights the role of the replayed samples and the relationship between task
subspaces. Surprisingly, we find that, even in a noiseless setting, forgetting
can be non-monotonic with respect to the number of replay samples. We present
tasks where replay can be harmful with respect to worst-case settings, and also
in distributional settings where replay of randomly selected samples increases
forgetting in expectation. We also give empirical evidence that harmful replay
is not limited to training with linear models by showing similar behavior for a
neural networks equipped with SGD. Through experiments on a commonly used
benchmark, we provide additional evidence that, even in seemingly benign
scenarios, performance of the replay heavily depends on the choice of replay
samples and the relationship between tasks.

### [156] [Bridging the Performance Gap Between Target-Free and Target-Based Reinforcement Learning With Iterated Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04398)
*Théo Vincent,Yogesh Tripathi,Tim Faust,Yaniv Oren,Jan Peters,Carlo D'Eramo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new method called iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL) which uses a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network while sharing the remaining parameters, improving sample efficiency and reducing memory usage for target-free reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve sample efficiency and reduce memory usage in target-free reinforcement learning by leveraging the concept of iterated Q-learning.

Method: Using a copy of the last linear layer of the online network as a target network while sharing the remaining parameters, enabling learning consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel.

Result: The proposed method improves the sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings and requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training time to classical target-based algorithms.

Conclusion: This novel method, iS-QL, shows promise in scaling reinforcement learning research by addressing the limitations of both target-based and target-free methods.

Abstract: In value-based reinforcement learning, removing the target network is
tempting as the boostrapped target would be built from up-to-date estimates,
and the spared memory occupied by the target network could be reallocated to
expand the capacity of the online network. However, eliminating the target
network introduces instability, leading to a decline in performance. Removing
the target network also means we cannot leverage the literature developed
around target networks. In this work, we propose to use a copy of the last
linear layer of the online network as a target network, while sharing the
remaining parameters with the up-to-date online network, hence stepping out of
the binary choice between target-based and target-free methods. It enables us
to leverage the concept of iterated Q-learning, which consists of learning
consecutive Bellman iterations in parallel, to reduce the performance gap
between target-free and target-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that
this novel method, termed iterated Shared Q-Learning (iS-QL), improves the
sample efficiency of target-free approaches across various settings.
Importantly, iS-QL requires a smaller memory footprint and comparable training
time to classical target-based algorithms, highlighting its potential to scale
reinforcement learning research.

*Suzan Ece Ada,Emre Ugur*

TL;DR: A new method called UMCNP is introduced for few-shot meta-RL, which uses CNPs to improve sample efficiency during meta-testing without needing extra meta-training samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of missing reward signals during meta-testing and enhance sample efficiency.

Method: Combining PPG-based meta-RL and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL while using CNPs to infer latent representations.

Result: UMCNP shows better performance than baselines in adapting to unseen tasks with fewer samples in 2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed UMCNP method effectively improves sample efficiency in few-shot meta-RL tasks without additional meta-training samples.

Abstract: We introduce Unsupervised Meta-Testing with Conditional Neural Processes
(UMCNP), a novel hybrid few-shot meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) method
that uniquely combines, yet distinctly separates, parameterized policy
gradient-based (PPG) and task inference-based few-shot meta-RL. Tailored for
settings where the reward signal is missing during meta-testing, our method
increases sample efficiency without requiring additional samples in
meta-training. UMCNP leverages the efficiency and scalability of Conditional
Neural Processes (CNPs) to reduce the number of online interactions required in
meta-testing. During meta-training, samples previously collected through PPG
meta-RL are efficiently reused for learning task inference in an offline
manner. UMCNP infers the latent representation of the transition dynamics model
from a single test task rollout with unknown parameters. This approach allows
us to generate rollouts for self-adaptation by interacting with the learned
dynamics model. We demonstrate our method can adapt to an unseen test task
using significantly fewer samples during meta-testing than the baselines in
2D-Point Agent and continuous control meta-RL benchmarks, namely, cartpole with
unknown angle sensor bias, walker agent with randomized dynamics parameters.

TL;DR: This work proves that standard contrastive learning objectives implicitly approximate a negatives-only supervised contrastive loss, and introduces a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish the theoretical foundations of self-supervised contrastive learning.

Method: Prove the relationship between standard contrastive learning objectives and a negatives-only supervised contrastive loss, and introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing.

Result: The gap between the CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, and the proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance in practice.

Conclusion: This work fills the gap in the theoretical foundations of self-supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundations of self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) are not yet fully established. In this work, we
address this gap by showing that standard CL objectives implicitly approximate
a supervised variant we call the negatives-only supervised contrastive loss
(NSCL), which excludes same-class contrasts. We prove that the gap between the
CL and NSCL losses vanishes as the number of semantic classes increases, under
a bound that is both label-agnostic and architecture-independent.
  We characterize the geometric structure of the global minimizers of the NSCL
loss: the learned representations exhibit augmentation collapse, within-class
collapse, and class centers that form a simplex equiangular tight frame. We
further introduce a new bound on the few-shot error of linear-probing. This
bound depends on two measures of feature variability--within-class dispersion
and variation along the line between class centers. We show that directional
variation dominates the bound and that the within-class dispersion's effect
diminishes as the number of labeled samples increases. These properties enable
CL and NSCL-trained representations to support accurate few-shot label recovery
using simple linear probes.
  Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings: the gap between CL
and NSCL losses decays at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\#\text{classes}})$;
the two losses are highly correlated; minimizing the CL loss implicitly brings
the NSCL loss close to the value achieved by direct minimization; and the
proposed few-shot error bound provides a tight estimate of probing performance
in practice.

*Egor Petrov,Grigoriy Evseev,Aleksey Antonov,Andrey Veprikov,Pavel Plyusnin,Nikolay Bushkov,Stanislav Moiseev,Aleksandr Beznosikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates zero-order optimization methods for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, proposing two new algorithms (	exttt{JAGUAR SignSGD} and 	exttt{JAGUAR Muon}) that match or exceed the performance of first-order methods while reducing memory usage significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional first-order optimizers are computationally expensive for fine-tuning large language models. Zero-order optimization methods offer a more memory and compute-efficient alternative.

Method: The authors propose two new zero-order optimization algorithms: 	exttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}, which extends ZO SignSGD with momentum, and 	exttt{JAGUAR Muon}, which leverages the matrix structure of model parameters. They also provide convergence guarantees for these algorithms.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed algorithms perform as well as or better than standard first-order methods on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, with significant memory savings.

Conclusion: This work establishes zero-order optimization methods as a practical and theoretically sound approach for resource-constrained fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for adapting
pre-trained models to downstream tasks. Yet traditional first-order optimizers
such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and
computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we
investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and
compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of
parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose
$\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO
SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and
only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees
for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR
Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix
structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under
arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM
fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or
exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving
significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish
new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for resource-constrained LLM adaptation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: KOALA++ is a new optimization algorithm for neural networks that handles gradient uncertainty more effectively than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve upon existing optimization algorithms by modeling structured gradient uncertainty.

Method: Kalman-based optimization algorithm that recursively updates gradient covariance products.

Result: Achieves accuracy equal to or better than state-of-the-art optimizers while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: KOALA++ provides a scalable and efficient approach to neural network optimization with improved handling of gradient uncertainty.

Abstract: We propose KOALA++, a scalable Kalman-based optimization algorithm that
explicitly models structured gradient uncertainty in neural network training.
Unlike second-order methods, which rely on expensive second order gradient
calculation, our method directly estimates the parameter covariance matrix by
recursively updating compact gradient covariance products. This design improves
upon the original KOALA framework that assumed diagonal covariance by
implicitly capturing richer uncertainty structure without storing the full
covariance matrix and avoiding large matrix inversions. Across diverse tasks,
including image classification and language modeling, KOALA++ achieves accuracy
on par or better than state-of-the-art first- and second-order optimizers while
maintaining the efficiency of first-order methods.

*Hari K. Prakash,Charles H. Martin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies a new phase in neural network training called 'anti-grokking', which is characterized by the collapse of test accuracy while training accuracy remains perfect. The study also shows that the HTSR layer quality metric α can clearly differentiate all three phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to understand the grokking phenomena in neural networks more deeply and to find ways to measure overfitting and generalization collapse.

Method: The research used a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST with and without weight decay. They also used the WeightWatcher tool to analyze the HTSR.

Result: The study found a novel phase called 'anti-grokking' where test accuracy collapses while training accuracy stays perfect. This phase is distinct from pre-grokking and grokking phases and is not detected by other proposed grokking progress measures.

Conclusion: The paper discovers a new phase called 'anti-grokking' during the training of neural networks. It also shows that the Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) layer quality metric α can clearly differentiate all three phases.

Abstract: We study the well-known grokking phenomena in neural networks (NNs) using a
3-layer MLP trained on 1 k-sample subset of MNIST, with and without weight
decay, and discover a novel third phase -- \emph{anti-grokking} -- that occurs
very late in training and resembles but is distinct from the familiar
\emph{pre-grokking} phases: test accuracy collapses while training accuracy
stays perfect. This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known
pre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed
grokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR
through the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality
metric $\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing
metrics detect only the first two. The \emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by
training for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\alpha < 2$ and the
appearance of \emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the
randomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and
signal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual
inspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using
Kolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra. Comparative metrics, including
activation sparsity, absolute weight entropy, circuit complexity, and $l^2$
weight norms track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to distinguish grokking
from anti-grokking. This discovery provides a way to measure overfitting and
generalization collapse without direct access to the test data. These results
strengthen the claim that the \emph{HTSR} $\alpha$ provides universal
layer-convergence target at $\alpha \approx 2$ and underscore the value of
using the HTSR alpha $(\alpha)$ metric as a measure of generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-step retrosynthesis remains challenging despite advancements in generative approaches.

Method: Introduces RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF), a discrete flow-matching framework with reaction center identification and Feynman-Kac steering with Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling.

Result: Achieves 60.0% top-1 accuracy, outperforming previous SOTA by 20%. FK-steering improves top-5 round-trip accuracy by 19% over prior template-free SOTA methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of RSF in improving both accuracy and diversity of generated samples in single-step retrosynthesis.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in organic chemistry is identifying and predicting the
series of reactions that synthesize a desired target product molecule. Due to
the combinatorial nature of the chemical search space, single-step reactant
prediction -- i.e. single-step retrosynthesis -- remains challenging even for
existing state-of-the-art template-free generative approaches to produce an
accurate yet diverse set of feasible reactions. In this paper, we model
single-step retrosynthesis planning and introduce RETRO SYNFLOW (RSF) a
discrete flow-matching framework that builds a Markov bridge between the
prescribed target product molecule and the reactant molecule. In contrast to
past approaches, RSF employs a reaction center identification step to produce
intermediate structures known as synthons as a more informative source
distribution for the discrete flow. To further enhance diversity and
feasibility of generated samples, we employ Feynman-Kac steering with
Sequential Monte Carlo based resampling to steer promising generations at
inference using a new reward oracle that relies on a forward-synthesis model.
Empirically, we demonstrate \nameshort achieves $60.0 \%$ top-1 accuracy, which
outperforms the previous SOTA by $20 \%$. We also substantiate the benefits of
steering at inference and demonstrate that FK-steering improves top-$5$
round-trip accuracy by $19 \%$ over prior template-free SOTA methods, all while
preserving competitive top-$k$ accuracy results.

*Gil I. Shamir,Manfred K. Warmuth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces selective matching loss functions to improve prediction accuracy in important subsets of data by designing link functions that emphasize higher sensitivity in critical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue where accurate predictions are crucial in specific regions of the data domain while less so in others.

Method: Constructing selective matching loss functions using link functions like Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine, specifically tailored for multidimensional selective losses through composite Softmax functions.

Result: The proposed method shows significant improvement over traditional losses in applications such as dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking, distillation problems, and aligning Large Language Models.

Conclusion: Selective losses provide a way to enhance model performance in regions of higher importance, overcoming limitations of standard Softmax functions and improving outcomes in various applications.

Abstract: Learning systems match predicted scores to observations over some domain.
Often, it is critical to produce accurate predictions in some subset (or
region) of the domain, yet less important to accurately predict in other
regions. We construct selective matching loss functions by design of increasing
link functions over score domains. A matching loss is an integral over the
link. A link defines loss sensitivity as function of the score, emphasizing
high slope high sensitivity regions over flat ones. Loss asymmetry drives a
model and resolves its underspecification to predict better in high sensitivity
regions where it is more important, and to distinguish between high and low
importance regions. A large variety of selective scalar losses can be designed
with scaled and shifted Sigmoid and hyperbolic sine links. Their properties,
however, do not extend to multi-class. Applying them per dimension lacks
ranking sensitivity that assigns importance according to class score ranking.
Utilizing composite Softmax functions, we develop a framework for
multidimensional selective losses. We overcome limitations of the standard
Softmax function, that is good for classification, but not for distinction
between adjacent scores. Selective losses have substantial advantage over
traditional losses in applications with more important score regions, including
dwell-time prediction, retrieval, ranking with either pointwise, contrastive
pairwise, or listwise losses, distillation problems, and fine-tuning alignment
of Large Language Models (LLMs).

*Huynh T. T. Tran,Jacob Sander,Achraf Cohen,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper extends ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI framework, with new methods to improve reliability assessment and explores transfer learning in cybersecurity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the robustness, interpretability, and generalization of NIDS by improving the reliability assessment of predictions, and to explore the potential of transfer learning in cybersecurity.

Method: The method involves integrating score-based methods (Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy) and metamodel-based techniques (SHAP values, Information Gain) into the original ODXU framework. A transfer learning strategy is also developed to enable reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different dataset.

Result: On the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, ODXU outperforms traditional neural models in six evaluation metrics. With the transfer learning strategy, ODXU outperforms traditional neural models on the ACI-IoT-2023 dataset when trained with as few as 16,000 samples. Metamodel-based UQ methods outperform score-based approaches on both datasets.

Conclusion: ODXU, an NSAI framework, has been successfully extended with new methods to improve reliability assessment. It surpasses traditional neural models in various performance metrics. Moreover, a novel transfer learning strategy for ODXU has been developed, which shows significant improvement in performance compared to traditional neural models when used with limited data.

Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) play a vital role in protecting
digital infrastructures against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. In
this paper, we extend ODXU, a Neurosymbolic AI (NSAI) framework that integrates
deep embedded clustering for feature extraction, symbolic reasoning using
XGBoost, and comprehensive uncertainty quantification (UQ) to enhance
robustness, interpretability, and generalization in NIDS. The extended ODXU
incorporates score-based methods (e.g., Confidence Scoring, Shannon Entropy)
and metamodel-based techniques, including SHAP values and Information Gain, to
assess the reliability of predictions. Experimental results on the CIC-IDS-2017
dataset show that ODXU outperforms traditional neural models across six
evaluation metrics, including classification accuracy and false omission rate.
While transfer learning has seen widespread adoption in fields such as computer
vision and natural language processing, its potential in cybersecurity has not
been thoroughly explored. To bridge this gap, we develop a transfer learning
strategy that enables the reuse of a pre-trained ODXU model on a different
dataset. Our ablation study on ACI-IoT-2023 demonstrates that the optimal
transfer configuration involves reusing the pre-trained autoencoder, retraining
the clustering module, and fine-tuning the XGBoost classifier, and outperforms
traditional neural models when trained with as few as 16,000 samples
(approximately 50% of the training data). Additionally, results show that
metamodel-based UQ methods consistently outperform score-based approaches on
both datasets.

Conclusion: 指出需要进一步评估ML模型中表征的系统性。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: To improve the classification of dental providers into standard and safety net clinic categories using machine learning models.

Method: The study uses a 2018 dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features including service counts and demographic information. It employs various feature ranking methods and evaluates twelve machine learning models using 10-fold cross-validation.

systems (FFS, managed care), and beneficiary demographics. Feature ranking
methods such as information gain, Gini index, and ANOVA were employed to
identify critical predictors, revealing treatment-related metrics
(TXMT_USER_CNT, TXMT_SVC_CNT) as top-ranked features. Twelve ML models,
including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and
Gradient Boosting, were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation.
Classification accuracy was tested across incremental feature subsets derived
from rankings. The Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy (94.1%) using
all 20 features, followed by Gradient Boosting (93.2%) and Random Forest
(93.0%). Models showed improved performance as more features were incorporated,
with SGD and ensemble methods demonstrating robustness to missing data. Feature
ranking highlighted the dominance of treatment service counts and annotation
codes in distinguishing provider types, while demographic variables (AGE_GROUP,
CALENDAR_YEAR) had minimal impact. The study underscores the importance of
feature selection in enhancing model efficiency and accuracy, particularly in
imbalanced healthcare datasets. These findings advocate for integrating
feature-ranking techniques with advanced ML algorithms to optimize dental
provider classification, enabling targeted resource allocation for underserved
populations.

Abstract: Dental provider classification plays a crucial role in optimizing healthcare
resource allocation and policy planning. Effective categorization of providers,
such as standard rendering providers and safety net clinic (SNC) providers,
enhances service delivery to underserved populations. This study aimed to
evaluate the performance of machine learning models in classifying dental
providers using a 2018 dataset. A dataset of 24,300 instances with 20 features
was analyzed, including beneficiary and service counts across fee-for-service
(FFS), Geographic Managed Care, and Pre-Paid Health Plans. Providers were
categorized by delivery system and patient age groups (0-20 and 21+). Despite
38.1% missing data, multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest, Neural Networks, and Gradient
Boosting. A 10-fold cross-validation approach was applied, and models were
evaluated using AUC, classification accuracy (CA), F1-score, precision, and
recall. Neural Networks achieved the highest AUC (0.975) and CA (94.1%),
followed by Random Forest (AUC: 0.948, CA: 93.0%). These models effectively
handled imbalanced data and complex feature interactions, outperforming
traditional classifiers like Logistic Regression and SVM. Advanced machine
learning techniques, particularly ensemble and deep learning models,
significantly enhance dental workforce classification. Their integration into
healthcare analytics can improve provider identification and resource
distribution, benefiting underserved populations.

Motivation: 在资源约束下，最优选择模型和适应策略具有挑战性且需要大量实验。研究是否可以通过廉价的预测来准确预测性能和成本。

Method: 提出了一种名为COSMOS的统一预测框架，使用嵌入增强的轻量级代理模型预测微调性能，以及低样本缩放定律预测检索增强上下文学习。

Result: COSMOS在八个代表性基准上进行了广泛的评估，平均减少了92.72%的计算成本，在资源密集型场景中最多减少98.71%。

Conclusion: COSMOS实现了高效预测LLMs适应结果，大幅降低了计算开销，并保持性能标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across numerous
tasks by using a diverse array of adaptation strategies. However, optimally
selecting a model and adaptation strategy under resource constraints is
challenging and often requires extensive experimentation. We investigate
whether it is possible to accurately predict both performance and cost without
expensive trials. We formalize the strategy selection problem for LLMs and
introduce COSMOS, a unified prediction framework that efficiently estimates
adaptation outcomes at minimal cost. We instantiate and study the capability of
our framework via a pair of powerful predictors: embedding-augmented
lightweight proxy models to predict fine-tuning performance, and low-sample
scaling laws to forecast retrieval-augmented in-context learning. Extensive
evaluation across eight representative benchmarks demonstrates that COSMOS
achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational costs by 92.72%
on average, and up to 98.71% in resource-intensive scenarios. Our results show
that efficient prediction of adaptation outcomes is not only feasible but can
substantially reduce the computational overhead of LLM deployment while
maintaining performance standards.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide evidence that orthogonalizing gradients during training improves
model calibration without sacrificing accuracy. On CIFAR-10 with 10% labeled
data, $\perp$Grad matches SGD in accuracy but yields consistently improved
calibration metrics such as lower test loss, reduced softmax overconfidence,
and higher predictive entropy. These benefits persist under input corruption
(CIFAR-10C) and extended training, where $\perp$Grad models degrade more
gracefully than SGD-trained counterparts. $\perp$Grad is optimizer-agnostic,
incurs minimal overhead, and works well with post-hoc calibration techniques
like temperature scaling.
  Theoretically, we prove convergence of a simplified version of $\perp$Grad
under mild assumptions and characterize its stationary points in positive
homogeneous networks: $\perp$Grad converges to solutions where further loss
reduction requires confidence scaling rather than decision boundary
improvement.

TL;DR: CryoBoltz combines cryo-EM density maps and protein structure prediction models to generate accurate atomic models for dynamic biomolecular systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure prediction models struggle with capturing conformational diversity while cryo-EM faces challenges in processing raw data to atomic models.

Method: CryoBoltz uses global and local structural constraints from cryo-EM density maps to guide the sampling trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model.

Result: The method successfully builds atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across various dynamic biomolecular systems such as transporters and antibodies.

Conclusion: CryoBoltz bridges the gap between protein structure prediction models and cryo-EM by leveraging their strengths to predict conformational diversity more accurately.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D
structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to
capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often
requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative
states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a
powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is
challenged by arduous pipelines to go from raw experimental data to atomic
models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM
density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein
structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling
trajectory of a pretrained protein structure prediction model using both global
and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions
towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We
demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us
to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of
dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.

TL;DR: Introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT) for physical reservoir computing which can perform gradient updates without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical reservoir computing cannot perform backpropagation due to its black-box nature.

Method: Use random perturbations in parameter space to approximate gradient updates with forward passes.

Result: PGT achieves performance similar to backpropagation methods on both simulated networks and hardware.

Conclusion: PGT enables integration of physical reservoirs into deeper neural networks and improves energy efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Perturbative Gradient Training (PGT), a novel training paradigm
that overcomes a critical limitation of physical reservoir computing: the
inability to perform backpropagation due to the black-box nature of physical
reservoirs. Drawing inspiration from perturbation theory in physics, PGT uses
random perturbations in the network's parameter space to approximate gradient
updates using only forward passes. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
approach on both simulated neural network architectures, including a dense
network and a transformer model with a reservoir layer, and on experimental
hardware using a magnonic auto-oscillation ring as the physical reservoir. Our
results show that PGT can achieve performance comparable to that of standard
backpropagation methods in cases where backpropagation is impractical or
impossible. PGT represents a promising step toward integrating physical
reservoirs into deeper neural network architectures and achieving significant
energy efficiency gains in AI training.

Result: Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high short-term accuracy and long-term stable forecasts, outperforming autoregressive baselines with minimal additional computational cost.

Conclusion: The introduced multiscale implicit neural emulator effectively enhances long-term prediction accuracy and ensures stability and physical consistency in solving complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Neural PDE solvers offer a powerful tool for modeling complex dynamical
systems, but often struggle with error accumulation over long time horizons and
maintaining stability and physical consistency. We introduce a multiscale
implicit neural emulator that enhances long-term prediction accuracy by
conditioning on a hierarchy of lower-dimensional future state representations.
Drawing inspiration from the stability properties of numerical implicit
time-stepping methods, our approach leverages predictions several steps ahead
in time at increasing compression rates for next-timestep refinements. By
actively adjusting the temporal downsampling ratios, our design enables the
model to capture dynamics across multiple granularities and enforce long-range
temporal coherence. Experiments on turbulent fluid dynamics show that our
method achieves high short-term accuracy and produces long-term stable
forecasts, significantly outperforming autoregressive baselines while adding

TL;DR: HALoS is a hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that reduces communication costs and improves efficiency in training large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on geographically distributed accelerators for training large language models leads to high communication costs and inefficient use of hardware.

Method: Introduces local parameter servers within each region and a global parameter server that merges updates across regions.

Result: Empirically, HALoS achieves up to 7.5x faster convergence than synchronous baselines and up to 2.1x improvement over existing asynchronous methods while maintaining or improving model quality.

Conclusion: Hierarchical, server-side update accumulation and global model merging are effective strategies for scalable, efficient training of large language models in heterogeneous, geo-distributed environments.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) increasingly relies on geographically
distributed accelerators, causing prohibitive communication costs across
regions and uneven utilization of heterogeneous hardware. We propose HALoS, a
hierarchical asynchronous optimization framework that tackles these issues by
introducing local parameter servers (LPSs) within each region and a global
parameter server (GPS) that merges updates across regions. This hierarchical
design minimizes expensive inter-region communication, reduces straggler
effects, and leverages fast intra-region links. We provide a rigorous
convergence analysis for HALoS under non-convex objectives, including
theoretical guarantees on the role of hierarchical momentum in asynchronous
training. Empirically, HALoS attains up to 7.5x faster convergence than
synchronous baselines in geo-distributed LLM training and improves upon
existing asynchronous methods by up to 2.1x. Crucially, HALoS preserves the
model quality of fully synchronous SGD-matching or exceeding accuracy on
standard language modeling and downstream benchmarks-while substantially
lowering total training time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical,
server-side update accumulation and global model merging are powerful tools for
scalable, efficient training of new-era LLMs in heterogeneous, geo-distributed
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOBLE, a neural operator framework, addresses limitations in modeling human neurons by predicting distributions of neural dynamics using interpretable neuron features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling approaches face challenges due to limited and variable experimental data, and existing deep learning methods fail to capture full biophysical complexity.

Method: NOBLE learns a mapping from interpretable neuron features to somatic voltage responses, trained on biophysically realistic neuron models.

Result: NOBLE achieves a 4200x speedup over numerical solvers and generates synthetic neurons with trial-to-trial variability.

Conclusion: NOBLE enables better understanding of neural properties and has potential applications in neuromorphic architectures and neuroAI.

Abstract: Characterizing the diverse computational properties of human neurons via
multimodal electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data
provides the foundation for constructing and validating bio-realistic neuron
models that can advance our understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying
brain function. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the
limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data.
To capture variability, ensembles of deterministic models are often used, but
are difficult to scale as model generation requires repeating computationally
expensive optimization for each neuron. While deep learning is becoming
increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical
complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework
that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of
interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by
current injection. Trained on data generated from biophysically realistic
neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for
the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic
neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose
dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE is the
first scaled-up deep learning framework validated on real experimental data,
enabling efficient generation of synthetic neurons that exhibit trial-to-trial
variability and achieve a $4200\times$ speedup over numerical solvers. To this
end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties, opening the door to a better
understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic
architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents Neural MJD, a neural network-based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion model that combines Itô diffusion and compound Poisson process to model non-stationary stochastic dynamics and abrupt jumps. The model introduces a likelihood truncation mechanism and a novel solver, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods struggle with generalizing to non-stationary data, especially when there are abrupt changes. The paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a model that can explicitly model underlying stochastic processes.

Method: The method involves creating a non-stationary Merton jump diffusion model using a time-inhomogeneous Itô diffusion and a time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process. A likelihood truncation mechanism is used to cap the number of jumps, and an Euler-Maruyama with restart solver is proposed.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that Neural MJD outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical learning methods.

Conclusion: Neural MJD successfully models non-stationary stochastic processes and abrupt jumps, showing better performance than current methods.

Abstract: While deep learning methods have achieved strong performance in time series
prediction, their black-box nature and inability to explicitly model underlying
stochastic processes often limit their generalization to non-stationary data,
especially in the presence of abrupt changes. In this work, we introduce Neural
MJD, a neural network based non-stationary Merton jump diffusion (MJD) model.
Our model explicitly formulates forecasting as a stochastic differential
equation (SDE) simulation problem, combining a time-inhomogeneous It\^o
diffusion to capture non-stationary stochastic dynamics with a
time-inhomogeneous compound Poisson process to model abrupt jumps. To enable
tractable learning, we introduce a likelihood truncation mechanism that caps
the number of jumps within small time intervals and provide a theoretical error
bound for this approximation. Additionally, we propose an Euler-Maruyama with
restart solver, which achieves a provably lower error bound in estimating
expected states and reduced variance compared to the standard solver.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Neural
MJD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and statistical
learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of datasets and number of devices in federated learning lead to bottlenecks and heterogeneity challenges.

Method: Introduces mdQFL, an efficient and adaptable algorithm for quantum federated learning.

Result: mdQFL reduces total communication costs by nearly 50%, maintains or improves model accuracy, and improves local model training compared to the standard QFL baseline.

Conclusion: mdQFL is the first to explore training and update personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, and can be applied to other FL scenarios.

Abstract: Training with huge datasets and a large number of participating devices leads
to bottlenecks in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, the challenges of
heterogeneity between multiple FL clients affect the overall performance of the
system. In a quantum federated learning (QFL) context, we address these three
main challenges: i) training bottlenecks from massive datasets, ii) the
involvement of a substantial number of devices, and iii) non-IID data
distributions. We introduce a model-driven quantum federated learning algorithm
(mdQFL) to tackle these challenges. Our proposed approach is efficient and
adaptable to various factors, including different numbers of devices. To the
best of our knowledge, it is the first to explore training and update
personalization, as well as test generalization within a QFL setting, which can
be applied to other FL scenarios. We evaluated the efficiency of the proposed
mdQFL framework through extensive experiments under diverse non-IID data
heterogeneity conditions using various datasets within the Qiskit environment.
Our results demonstrate a nearly 50% decrease in total communication costs
while maintaining or, in some cases, exceeding the accuracy of the final model
and consistently improving local model training compared to the standard QFL
baseline. Moreover, our experimental evaluation thoroughly explores the QFL and
mdQFL algorithms, along with several influencing factors. In addition, we
present a theoretical analysis to clarify the complexities of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental code is available at 1.

Abstract: Unsupervised machine learning is widely used to mine large, unlabeled
datasets to make data-driven discoveries in critical domains such as climate
science, biomedicine, astronomy, chemistry, and more. However, despite its
widespread utilization, there is a lack of standardization in unsupervised

In this paper, we present a structured workflow for using unsupervised learning
techniques in science. We highlight and discuss best practices starting with
formulating validatable scientific questions, conducting robust data
preparation and exploration, using a range of modeling techniques, performing
rigorous validation by evaluating the stability and generalizability of
unsupervised learning conclusions, and promoting effective communication and
documentation of results to ensure reproducible scientific discoveries. To
illustrate our proposed workflow, we present a case study from astronomy,
seeking to refine globular clusters of Milky Way stars based upon their
chemical composition. Our case study highlights the importance of validation
and illustrates how the benefits of a carefully-designed workflow for
unsupervised learning can advance scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generate private synthetic text using differential privacy with improved quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform sampling degrades text quality for diverse topics, necessitating better methods.

Method: Cluster data before creating inference batches and compute medians instead of averages for next token statistics.

Result: Improved representativeness and downstream task performance with reduced privacy cost compared to prior state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Our method enhances the quality of private synthetic text generation while lowering privacy costs.

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accommodating multiple large models within constrained memory budgets.

Method: StatsMerging leverages singular values from SVD to capture task-specific weight distributions and employs a lightweight learner called StatsMergeLearner to model these distributions. It also introduces Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous architectures.

Result: StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality variations.

Conclusion: StatsMerging is an effective and efficient method for model merging, offering improvements in performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising solution to accommodate multiple
large models within constrained memory budgets. We present StatsMerging, a
novel lightweight learning-based model merging method guided by weight
distribution statistics without requiring ground truth labels or test samples.
StatsMerging offers three key advantages: (1) It uniquely leverages singular
values from singular value decomposition (SVD) to capture task-specific weight
distributions, serving as a proxy for task importance to guide task coefficient
prediction; (2) It employs a lightweight learner StatsMergeLearner to model the
weight distributions of task-specific pre-trained models, improving
generalization and enhancing adaptation to unseen samples; (3) It introduces
Task-Specific Teacher Distillation for merging vision models with heterogeneous
architectures, a merging learning paradigm that avoids costly ground-truth
labels by task-specific teacher distillation. Notably, we present two types of
knowledge distillation, (a) distilling knowledge from task-specific models to
StatsMergeLearner; and (b) distilling knowledge from models with heterogeneous
architectures prior to merging. Extensive experiments across eight tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of StatsMerging. Our results show that
StatsMerging outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of overall
accuracy, generalization to unseen tasks, and robustness to image quality
variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We derive and compare scaling laws for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, showing that MaMMUT improves more strongly with scale and is more sample efficient. We validate these results across different downstream tasks and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a method for comparing models and datasets across different scales, avoiding misleading conclusions from single-scale measurements.

Method: Deriving full scaling laws for CLIP and MaMMUT using dense measurements across a wide range of model and sample scales.

Result: MaMMUT shows stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than CLIP. These results are consistent across various downstream tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Accurate derivation of scaling laws allows systematic comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets.

Abstract: In studies of transferable learning, scaling laws are obtained for various
important foundation models to predict their properties and performance at
larger scales. We show here how scaling law derivation can also be used for
model and dataset comparison, allowing to decide which procedure is to be
preferred for pre-training. For the first time, full scaling laws based on
dense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are
derived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,
that use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative
loss. Ensuring sufficient prediction accuracy for held out points, we use
derived scaling laws to compare both models, obtaining evidence for MaMMUT's
stronger improvement with scale and better sample efficiency than standard
CLIP. To strengthen validity of the comparison, we show scaling laws for
various downstream tasks, classification, retrieval, and segmentation, and for
different open datasets, DataComp, DFN and Re-LAION, observing consistently the
same trends. We show that comparison can also be performed when deriving
scaling laws with a constant learning rate schedule, reducing compute cost.
Accurate derivation of scaling laws provides thus means to perform model and
dataset comparison across scale spans, avoiding misleading conclusions based on
measurements from single reference scales only, paving the road for systematic
comparison and improvement of open foundation models and datasets for their
creation. We release all the pre-trained models with their intermediate
checkpoints, including openMaMMUT-L/14, which achieves $80.3\%$ zero-shot
ImageNet-1k accuracy, trained on 12.8B samples from DataComp-1.4B. Code for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In critical domains, reliable explanations are essential for human decision-making. The common practice of graph symmetrization leads to significant information loss and misleading explanations.

Method: Theoretical and empirical studies were conducted to demonstrate the impact of graph symmetrization on explanation fidelity and the benefits of direction-aware semantics.

Result: Directional information preservation significantly enhances the quality of explanations provided by GNNs, leading to more faithful insights.

Conclusion: Preserving directional semantics improves explanation quality in Graph Neural Networks, which is crucial for reliable human decision-making in critical domains.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly used in critical domains, where
reliable explanations are vital for supporting human decision-making. However,
the common practice of graph symmetrization discards directional information,
leading to significant information loss and misleading explanations. Our
analysis demonstrates how this practice compromises explanation fidelity.
Through theoretical and empirical studies, we show that preserving directional
semantics significantly improves explanation quality, ensuring more faithful
insights for human decision-makers. These findings highlight the need for
direction-aware GNN explainability in security-critical applications.

*Cong Geng,Jia Wang,Li Chen,Zhiyong Gao,Jes Frellsen,Søren Hauberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose bidirectional bounds for training energy-based models (EBMs), which stabilize training and improve density estimation and sample generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBMs are hard to train due to instability, and recent work links them to GANs.

Method: Introduce bidirectional bounds by maximizing a lower bound and minimizing an upper bound.

Result: Improved stability in EBM training and better density estimation and sample generation.

Conclusion: Bidirectional bounds provide a more stable way to train EBMs.

Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) estimate unnormalized densities in an elegant
framework, but they are generally difficult to train. Recent work has linked
EBMs to generative adversarial networks, by noting that they can be trained
through a minimax game using a variational lower bound. To avoid the
instabilities caused by minimizing a lower bound, we propose to instead work
with bidirectional bounds, meaning that we maximize a lower bound and minimize
an upper bound when training the EBM. We investigate four different bounds on
the log-likelihood derived from different perspectives. We derive lower bounds
based on the singular values of the generator Jacobian and on mutual
information. To upper bound the negative log-likelihood, we consider a gradient
penalty-like bound, as well as one based on diffusion processes. In all cases,
we provide algorithms for evaluating the bounds. We compare the different
bounds to investigate, the pros and cons of the different approaches. Finally,
we demonstrate that the use of bidirectional bounds stabilizes EBM training and
yields high-quality density estimation and sample generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新方法来最小化代理系统中的风险，并通过算法优化代理组合的选择，实验表明其在控制基准测试中有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代代理系统需要将复杂目标分解成子任务，并选择专门的人工智能代理来完成这些任务。然而，在真实世界中部署这些系统时，除了最大化任务成功率外，还需要最小化风险，例如安全性、公平性和隐私性等要求。这需要仔细分析代理组合的低概率（尾部）行为。

Abstract: From software development to robot control, modern agentic systems decompose
complex objectives into a sequence of subtasks and choose a set of specialized
AI agents to complete them. We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed
acyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths
correspond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in
the real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize
the task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements
like safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully
analyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In
this work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible
agent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also
known as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition
where the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We
introduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a
near-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a
union bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the
approximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical
loss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video
game-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with
reinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in
approximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition.

Motivation: To address the trade-off between cost per token and serial token generation speed when deploying LLMs at scale.

Conclusion: The model helps to find optimal parallelism setups and batch sizes for efficient large language models inference.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical model that addresses the economic trade-off between

inference speed at a given cost per token. We use the model to compute Pareto
frontiers of serial speed versus cost per token for popular language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficiently adapting large pre-trained models to specific tasks is crucial. This survey unifies model adaptation techniques under the concept of neural network reprogrammability, showing how different methods manipulate information at model interfaces to change behavior without altering parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding of model adaptation techniques and their interrelationships.

Method: Introduces neural network reprogrammability as a unifying framework, categorizing adaptation approaches across four dimensions: manipulation format, location, operator, and output alignment requirement.

Result: Reveals theoretical connections and practical distinctions between techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting.

Conclusion: Positions neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for efficient model adaptation and identifies promising future research directions.

Abstract: As large-scale pre-trained foundation models continue to expand in size and
capability, efficiently adapting them to specific downstream tasks has become
increasingly critical. Despite substantial progress, existing adaptation
approaches have evolved largely in isolation, without a clear understanding of
their interrelationships. This survey introduces neural network
reprogrammability as a unifying framework that bridges mainstream model
adaptation techniques--model reprogramming, prompt tuning, and prompt
instruction--previously fragmented research areas yet converges on a shared
principle: repurposing a pre-trained model by manipulating information at the
interfaces while keeping the model parameters frozen. These methods exploit
neural networks' sensitivity to manipulation on different interfaces, be it
through perturbing inputs, inserting tokens into intermediate layers, or
providing task-specific examples in context, to redirect model behaviors
towards desired outcomes. We then present a taxonomy that categorizes such
information manipulation-based adaptation approaches across four key
dimensions: manipulation format (fixed or learnable), location (interfaces
where manipulations occur), operator (how they are applied), and output
alignment requirement (post-processing needed to align outputs with downstream
tasks). Notably, this framework applies consistently across data modalities,
independent of specific model architectures. Moreover, viewing established
techniques like in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting through this
lens reveals both their theoretical connections and practical distinctions. We
further analyze remaining technical challenges and ethical considerations,
positioning neural network reprogrammability as a fundamental paradigm for
efficient model adaptation. We lastly identify promising research directions
emerging from this integrative viewpoint.

*MoonJeong Park,Sunghyun Choi,Jaeseung Heo,Eunhyeok Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This position paper disputes the importance of oversmoothing in deep graph neural networks and promotes deeper exploration into their architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversmoothing has been considered as a major barrier to building deep GNNs. The paper aims to challenge previous views on this issue and advocate for further research into deep GNN structures.

Method: The authors examine the three core operations of GNNs: aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, and argue that oversmoothing is actually caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation.

Result: The study shows that traditional methods like skip connections and normalization can be used to stack deep GNN layers without loss of performance, which contradicts previous beliefs about oversmoothing in GNNs.

Conclusion: This position paper concludes that the impact of oversmoothing has been overemphasized and suggests more exploration into deep GNN architectures.

Abstract: Oversmoothing has been recognized as a main obstacle to building deep Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting the performance. This position paper argues
that the influence of oversmoothing has been overstated and advocates for a
further exploration of deep GNN architectures. Given the three core operations
of GNNs, aggregation, linear transformation, and non-linear activation, we show
that prior studies have mistakenly confused oversmoothing with the vanishing
gradient, caused by transformation and activation rather than aggregation. Our
finding challenges prior beliefs about oversmoothing being unique to GNNs.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that classical solutions such as skip connections
and normalization enable the successful stacking of deep GNN layers without
performance degradation. Our results clarify misconceptions about oversmoothing
and shed new light on the potential of deep GNNs.

Motivation: 部分多标签学习（PML）中的“维度灾难”问题以及现有PML方法在实际应用中的局限性，特别是它们在识别正标签方面的能力不足。

Conclusion: 提出了一个考虑数据集两个重要特性的部分多标签学习特征选择方法。实验结果表明所提出的方法优于基准数据集上的现有方法。

Abstract: The "Curse of dimensionality" is prevalent across various data patterns,
which increases the risk of model overfitting and leads to a decline in model
classification performance. However, few studies have focused on this issue in
Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), where each sample is associated with a set
of candidate labels, at least one of which is correct. Existing PML methods
addressing this problem are mainly based on the low-rank assumption. However,
low-rank assumption is difficult to be satisfied in practical situations and
may lead to loss of high-dimensional information. Furthermore, we find that
existing methods have poor ability to identify positive labels, which is
important in real-world scenarios. In this paper, a PML feature selection
method is proposed considering two important characteristics of dataset: label
relationship's noise-resistance and label connectivity. Our proposed method
utilizes label relationship's noise-resistance to disambiguate labels. Then the
learning process is designed through the reformed low-rank assumption. Finally,
representative labels are found through label connectivity, and the weight
matrix is reconstructed to select features with strong identification ability
to these labels. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于交替方向乘子法（ADMM）的联邦学习框架FedAPM，通过引入一阶和二阶近似项来减轻客户端漂移问题，并证明了其在收敛性上比其他方法更稳定和高效。实验表明，FedAPM在不同指标上的性能优于当前最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习方法假设不同设备的数据集是独立同分布的，但在实际应用中这一假设往往不成立。此外，不同客户端间存在多种数据模态使得单一模型难以适用，而部分模型个性化虽然可以解决问题，但可能加剧客户端漂移现象。

Method: 设计了一个新的联邦学习框架FedAPM，通过构造增广拉格朗日函数并加入一阶和二阶近似项来修正局部模型与共享模型之间的差异，从而缓解客户端漂移问题。

Result: FedAPM在四个异构多模态数据集上的实验结果显示，它能更快、更准确地收敛，在测试准确性、F1分数和AUC方面分别比现有最佳方法提高了12.3%、16.4%和18.0%，并且需要较少的通信轮次。

Conclusion: FedAPM提供了一种有效的解决方案来解决联邦学习中的客户端漂移问题，不仅提高了模型性能，还优化了资源利用率。

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), the assumption that datasets from different
devices are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) often does not
hold due to user differences, and the presence of various data modalities
across clients makes using a single model impractical. Personalizing certain
parts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts
to differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.
However, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client
drift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby
reducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL
framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),
referred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented
Lagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal
terms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction
and the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and
shared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit
estimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of
convergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global
convergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary
point, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under
mild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and
multimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of
FedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,
outperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test
accuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer
communication rounds.

*Marco Zanotti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost in ensemble learning for time series forecasting, finding that smaller ensembles can be nearly as effective as larger ones, and reducing retraining frequency can lower costs with little effect on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of datasets and complexity of forecasting models have made the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational cost a crucial issue, particularly in ensemble learning for time series forecasting.

Method: Ten base models and eight ensemble configurations were evaluated across two large-scale retail datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under varying retraining frequencies.

Result: Ensembles consistently improve forecasting performance, especially in probabilistic settings, but come at a high computational cost. Reducing retraining frequency significantly lowers costs with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for point forecasts. Efficiency-driven ensembles offer a good balance of accuracy and cost.

Conclusion: Careful ensemble design and retraining strategy selection can lead to accurate, robust, and cost-effective forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Given the continuous increase in dataset sizes and the complexity of
forecasting models, the trade-off between forecast accuracy and computational
cost is emerging as an extremely relevant topic, especially in the context of
ensemble learning for time series forecasting. To asses it, we evaluated ten
base models and eight ensemble configurations across two large-scale retail
datasets (M5 and VN1), considering both point and probabilistic accuracy under
varying retraining frequencies. We showed that ensembles consistently improve
forecasting performance, particularly in probabilistic settings. However, these
gains come at a substantial computational cost, especially for larger,
accuracy-driven ensembles. We found that reducing retraining frequency
significantly lowers costs, with minimal impact on accuracy, particularly for
point forecasts. Moreover, efficiency-driven ensembles offer a strong balance,
achieving competitive accuracy with considerably lower costs compared to
accuracy-optimized combinations. Most importantly, small ensembles of two or
three models are often sufficient to achieve near-optimal results. These
findings provide practical guidelines for deploying scalable and cost-efficient
forecasting systems, supporting the broader goals of sustainable AI in
forecasting. Overall, this work shows that careful ensemble design and
retraining strategy selection can yield accurate, robust, and cost-effective
forecasts suitable for real-world applications.

Motivation: To provide privacy-protected insights into LLM chatbot interactions.

Method: The framework uses private clustering and keyword extraction methods like frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided approaches along with DP tools.

Result: Urania shows good performance in preserving lexical and semantic content, pair similarity, and LLM-based metrics while being more robust than a non-private pipeline.

Conclusion: Urania balances data utility and privacy preservation well in generating conversational insights.

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

TL;DR: Introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet) to improve generalization by projecting inputs into learnable distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training loss alone offers limited insight into generalization performance in overparameterized models.

Method: Propose a new framework called DIPNet which projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer.

Result: Enhances test performance under various conditions including standard settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: DIPNet is a general and effective approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Abstract: As overparameterized models become increasingly prevalent, training loss
alone offers limited insight into generalization performance. While smoothness
has been linked to improved generalization across various settings, directly
enforcing smoothness in neural networks remains challenging. To address this,
we introduce Distributional Input Projection Networks (DIPNet), a novel
framework that projects inputs into learnable distributions at each layer. This
distributional representation induces a smoother loss landscape with respect to
the input, promoting better generalization. We provide theoretical analysis
showing that DIPNet reduces both local smoothness measures and the Lipschitz
constant of the network, contributing to improved generalization performance.
Empirically, we validate DIPNet across a wide range of architectures and tasks,
including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large Language Models (LLMs), ResNet and
MLPs. Our method consistently enhances test performance under standard
settings, adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution inputs, and reasoning
benchmarks. We demonstrate that the proposed input projection strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing models, providing a general and effective
approach for boosting generalization performance in modern deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work introduces a novel approach for predicting edge influence in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which improves upon existing methods by relaxing convexity requirements and considering both edge deletions and insertions. The method enhances interpretability and robustness of GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interpretability and robustness of GNNs by understanding how individual edges affect their behavior.

Method: Proposes a proximal Bregman response function tailored for GNNs, which relaxes convexity assumptions and predicts influence for both edge deletions and insertions.

Result: Accurate influence predictions were achieved for various GNN characteristics using real-world datasets. The method also showed versatility in graph rewiring and adversarial attack applications.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a more comprehensive and accurate way to predict edge influence in GNNs compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Understanding how individual edges influence the behavior of graph neural
networks (GNNs) is essential for improving their interpretability and
robustness. Graph influence functions have emerged as promising tools to
efficiently estimate the effects of edge deletions without retraining. However,
existing influence prediction methods rely on strict convexity assumptions,
exclusively consider the influence of edge deletions while disregarding edge
insertions, and fail to capture changes in message propagation caused by these
modifications. In this work, we propose a proximal Bregman response function
specifically tailored for GNNs, relaxing the convexity requirement and enabling
accurate influence prediction for standard neural network architectures.
Furthermore, our method explicitly accounts for message propagation effects and
extends influence prediction to both edge deletions and insertions in a
principled way. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate accurate
influence predictions for different characteristics of GNNs. We further
demonstrate that the influence function is versatile in applications such as
graph rewiring and adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms by which reinforcement learning improves reasoning abilities in large language models remains an open question.

Method: The authors conduct a systematic study of RLVR, analyzing its convergence and training dynamics using a simplified question-reason-answer model.

Result: RLVR-trained models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns, and the authors identify two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training.

Conclusion: This work advances the theoretical understanding of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and provides insights for further enhancing reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
model capabilities, including instruction-following, preference learning, and
reasoning. Yet despite its empirical successes, the mechanisms by which RL
improves reasoning abilities remain poorly understood. We present a systematic
study of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), showing that
its primary benefit comes from optimizing the selection of existing reasoning
patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLVR-trained
models preferentially adopt high-success-rate reasoning patterns while mostly
maintaining stable performance on individual patterns. We further develop
theoretical analyses on the convergence and training dynamics of RLVR based on
a simplified question-reason-answer model. We study the gradient flow and show
that RLVR can indeed find the solution that selects the reason pattern with the
highest success rate. Besides, our theoretical results
  reveal two distinct regimes regarding the convergence of RLVR training: (1)
rapid convergence for models with relatively strong initial reasoning
capabilities versus (2) slower optimization dynamics for weaker models.
Furthermore, we show that the slower optimization for weaker models can be
mitigated by applying the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) before RLVR, when using
a feasibly high-quality SFT dataset. We validate the theoretical findings
through extensive experiments. This work advances our theoretical understanding
of RL's role in LLM fine-tuning and offers insights for further enhancing
reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 孟加拉国由于其独特的地理和人为脆弱性，干旱对其农业、社会经济稳定和食品安全构成了普遍的环境挑战。传统干旱指数往往忽略了土壤湿度和温度等关键因素，而目前应用于干旱预测的机器学习模型在孟加拉国的探索尚不充分，缺乏对多地区卫星数据的全面整合。

Method: 使用无监督算法（如K-means和Bayesian高斯混合）进行聚类，然后使用分类模型（如KNN、随机森林、决策树和朴素贝叶斯）对天气数据进行整合。

Result: 该框架成功地将干旱严重程度分类为不同的级别，并显示出各地区在干旱脆弱性上的显著差异。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在识别和预测孟加拉国不同地区的干旱条件方面表现出显著的能力。

Abstract: Drought poses a pervasive environmental challenge in Bangladesh, impacting
agriculture, socio-economic stability, and food security due to its unique
geographic and anthropogenic vulnerabilities. Traditional drought indices, such
as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index
(PDSI), often overlook crucial factors like soil moisture and temperature,
limiting their resolution. Moreover, current machine learning models applied to
drought prediction have been underexplored in the context of Bangladesh,
lacking a comprehensive integration of satellite data across multiple
districts. To address these gaps, we propose a satellite data-driven machine
learning framework to classify drought across 38 districts of Bangladesh. Using
unsupervised algorithms like K-means and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture for
clustering, followed by classification models such as KNN, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes, the framework integrates weather data
(humidity, soil moisture, temperature) from 2012-2024. This approach
successfully classifies drought severity into different levels. However, it
shows significant variabilities in drought vulnerabilities across regions which
highlights the aptitude of machine learning models in terms of identifying and
predicting drought conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel likelihood-free objective named dual-ISL is introduced to train implicit generative models. Theoretical analysis proves that dual-ISL has advantageous properties compared to classical divergences, and empirical results show that it converges faster, trains more smoothly and stably, and prevents mode collapse better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a robust and effective tool for training implicit generative models.

Method: Introduce dual-ISL, a novel likelihood-free objective that interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL framework.

Result: Dual-ISL is continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the L1 norm, and convex in its first argument. It can be interpreted as an L2-projection of the density ratio onto a Bernstein polynomial basis.

Conclusion: Dual-ISL converges more rapidly, trains more smoothly and stably, and more effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading implicit generative methods.

Abstract: Rank-based statistical metrics, such as the invariant statistical loss (ISL),
have recently emerged as robust and practically effective tools for training
implicit generative models. In this work, we introduce dual-ISL, a novel
likelihood-free objective for training implicit generative models that
interchanges the roles of the target and model distributions in the ISL
framework, yielding a convex optimization problem in the space of model
densities. We prove that the resulting rank-based discrepancy $d_K$ is i)
continuous under weak convergence and with respect to the $L^1$ norm, and ii)
convex in its first argument-properties not shared by classical divergences
such as KL or Wasserstein distances. Building on this, we develop a theoretical
framework that interprets $d_K$ as an $L^2$-projection of the density ratio $q
= p/\tilde p$ onto a Bernstein polynomial basis, from which we derive exact
bounds on the truncation error, precise convergence rates, and a closed-form
expression for the truncated density approximation. We further extend our
analysis to the multivariate setting via random one-dimensional projections,
defining a sliced dual-ISL divergence that retains both convexity and
continuity. We empirically show that these theoretical advantages translate
into practical ones. Specifically, across several benchmarks dual-ISL converges
more rapidly, delivers markedly smoother and more stable training, and more
effectively prevents mode collapse than classical ISL and other leading
implicit generative methods-while also providing an explicit density
approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces fast unlearning algorithms for generative models based on loss gradient orthogonalization, which can effectively remove the influence of specific data points without retraining from scratch, significantly reducing unlearning time compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing importance of unlearning specific data in generative models due to privacy concerns, legal requirements, or correcting harmful content.

Method: Proposing fast unlearning algorithms using loss gradient orthogonalization.

Result: Algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than previous methods like gradient surgery.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms can effectively unlearn specific data while maintaining model quality and desired data influence.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly powerful and pervasive, the ability
to unlearn specific data, whether due to privacy concerns, legal requirements,
or the correction of harmful content, has become increasingly important. Unlike
in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is
reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular
data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and
reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data,
(ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the
influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small
number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss
gradient orthogonalization. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data
while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. Using MNIST and CelebA
data, we demonstrate that our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster

### [197] [Multi-Layer GRPO: Enhancing Reasoning and Self-Correction in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04746)
*Fei Ding,Baiqiao Wang,Zijian Zeng,Youwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO) to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models. It introduces a two-layer structure for self-correction, which enhances performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the problem of inefficient exploration dynamics and reward vanishing in the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm due to the absence of intermediate supervision.

Method: Introduce MGRPO with a two-layer structure where the first layer generates an initial response using GRPO, and the second layer is trained to identify and correct errors in the initial response, forming a self-correction loop.

Result: MGRPO outperforms standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks by improving both reasoning and self-correction abilities.

Conclusion: MGRPO demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-layer policy optimization in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models through implicit process-level supervision.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm has demonstrated
considerable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), as evidenced by DeepSeek-R1. However, the absence of
intermediate supervision in GRPO frequently leads to inefficient exploration
dynamics. A single error in a complex reasoning chain can invalidate the entire
solution, resulting in abrupt reward vanishing and compromising training
stability.To address these challenges, we propose MGRPO (Multi-layer GRPO).
MGRPO operates in two layers: the first layer employs standard GRPO to generate
an initial response. This response, along with the original query, is then fed
into a second-layer GRPO process. This second layer is specifically trained to
identify and correct errors in the initial response, effectively creating a
self-correction loop. This mechanism provides implicit process-level
supervision by rewarding successful error correction, without requiring an
explicit, densely-annotated reward model. Experimental results on several
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MGRPO significantly
outperforms standard GRPO, achieving superior performance by fostering both
reasoning and self-correction abilities.

*Han Guo,Songlin Yang,Tarushii Goel,Eric P. Xing,Tri Dao,Yoon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces log-linear attention, a new method that improves the efficiency and expressiveness of Transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of fixed-size hidden states in RNNs and improve the efficiency of sequence modeling.

Method: Log-linear attention replaces fixed-size hidden states with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states.

Result: Log-linear attention has a similar matmul-rich parallel form as linear attention and its compute cost is log-linear in sequence length.

Conclusion: Log-linear attention is a general framework that can be applied on top of existing linear attention variants.

Abstract: The attention mechanism in Transformers is an important primitive for
accurate and scalable sequence modeling. Its quadratic-compute and
linear-memory complexity however remain significant bottlenecks. Linear
attention and state-space models enable linear-time, constant-memory sequence
modeling and can moreover be trained efficiently through matmul-rich
parallelization across sequence length. However, at their core these models are
still RNNs, and thus their use of a fixed-size hidden state to model the
context is a fundamental limitation. This paper develops log-linear attention,
an attention mechanism that balances linear attention's efficiency and the
expressiveness of softmax attention. Log-linear attention replaces the
fixed-size hidden state with a logarithmically growing set of hidden states. We
show that with a particular growth function, log-linear attention admits a
similarly matmul-rich parallel form whose compute cost is log-linear in
sequence length. Log-linear attention is a general framework and can be applied
on top of existing linear attention variants. As case studies, we instantiate
log-linear variants of two recent architectures -- Mamba-2 and Gated DeltaNet
-- and find they perform well compared to their linear-time variants.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse domains. By leveraging attention mechanisms, GTs are capable of
modeling long-range dependencies and complex structural relationships beyond
local neighborhoods. However, their applicable scenarios are still
underexplored, this highlights the need to identify when and why they excel.
Furthermore, unlike GNNs, which predominantly rely on message-passing
mechanisms, GTs exhibit a diverse design space in areas such as positional
encoding, attention mechanisms, and graph-specific adaptations. Yet, it remains
unclear which of these design choices are truly effective and under what
conditions. As a result, the community currently lacks a comprehensive
benchmark and library to promote a deeper understanding and further development
of GTs. To address this gap, this paper introduces OpenGT, a comprehensive
benchmark for Graph Transformers. OpenGT enables fair comparisons and
multidimensional analysis by establishing standardized experimental settings
and incorporating a broad selection of state-of-the-art GNNs and GTs. Our
benchmark evaluates GTs from multiple perspectives, encompassing diverse tasks
and datasets with varying properties. Through extensive experiments, our
benchmark has uncovered several critical insights, including the difficulty of
transferring models across task levels, the limitations of local attention, the
efficiency trade-offs in several models, the application scenarios of specific
positional encodings, and the preprocessing overhead of some positional
encodings. We aspire for this work to establish a foundation for future graph
transformer research emphasizing fairness, reproducibility, and
generalizability. We have developed an easy-to-use library OpenGT for training
and evaluating existing GTs. The benchmark code is available at

*Artin Tajdini,Jonathan Scarlett,Kevin Jamieson*

TL;DR: 研究了具有重尾奖励的随机线性Bandits问题，改进了上下界，并提出了一种新的基于消除和实验设计的算法，提高了对维度d的依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的关于具有重尾奖励的随机线性Bandits问题的上下界存在差距，特别是在有限方差情况下。

Method: 提出了一种新的基于消除和实验设计的算法。

Result: 该算法实现了后悔的上界，改进了维度d的依赖性，并在特定几何形状下进一步减少了对d的依赖。

Conclusion: 对于具有重尾奖励的随机线性Bandits问题，我们提出了一个新的算法，该算法在不同维度和几何形状下表现更优。

Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the
rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by
$\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower
bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same
scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon =
\mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime
with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a
$\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound.
This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for
linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the
finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based
algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all
$\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$.
We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}}
T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit
rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For
finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for
regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing
that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we
can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle
infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing
new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear
for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.

*Thore Gerlach,Sascha Mücke,Christian Bauckhage*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reveals a structural link between k-medoids clustering and KDE-based VQ via QUBO formulations, offering new insights into their geometric interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to investigate the connection between two seemingly unrelated paradigms in hard VQ methods: distance-based k-medoids clustering and probability density matching KDE approach.

Method: The authors compared a heuristic QUBO formulation for k-medoids with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ.

Result: It was found that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the k-medoids-QUBO under certain assumptions on the kernel's feature map.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is a deeper structural relationship between k-medoids clustering and KDE-based VQ methods, which is revealed by their connection through QUBO.

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and
data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ
methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches
represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one
distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this
paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO
formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a
principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based
VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the
$k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This
reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and
provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting
parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.

### [202] [Adaptive Preconditioners Trigger Loss Spikes in Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04805)
*Zhiwei Bai,Zhangchen Zhou,Jiajie Zhao,Xiaolong Li,Zhiyu Li,Feiyu Xiong,Hongkang Yang,Yaoyu Zhang,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Investigating the cause of loss spikes in neural network training with the Adam optimizer, researchers found that the optimizer's adaptive preconditioners can trigger these spikes due to a specific condition where squared gradients are much smaller than second-order moment estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding why loss spikes occur during neural network training with the Adam optimizer.

Method: Analyzing the underlying mechanism of Adam spikes, identifying a critical regime where squared gradients are much smaller than second-order moment estimates, causing instability.

Result: The mechanism identified can push the maximum eigenvalue of the preconditioned Hessian beyond the stability threshold, leading to alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, resulting in loss spikes.

Conclusion: Adam's adaptive preconditioners can trigger loss spikes by a specific mechanism related to the relationship between squared gradients and second-order moment estimates.

Abstract: Loss spikes emerge commonly during training across neural networks of varying
architectures and scales when using the Adam optimizer. In this work, we
investigate the underlying mechanism responsible for Adam spikes. While
previous explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper
characteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's
adaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we
identify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller
than the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a
$\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient
information. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the
preconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\eta$ for a
sustained period, inducing instability. This instability further leads to an
alignment between the gradient and the maximum eigendirection, and a loss spike
occurs precisely when the gradient-directional curvature exceeds $2/\eta$. We
verify this mechanism through extensive experiments on fully connected
networks, convolutional networks, and Transformer architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 'play to learn' framework is proposed to enhance large language models' reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning on logic puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning pipelines may only instill domain-specific heuristics instead of general-purpose thinking strategies.

Method: Fine-tuning LLMs via reinforcement learning on custom logic puzzles designed to cultivate different reasoning skills.

Result: This method improves out-of-distribution performance on mathematical benchmarks, especially mid-difficulty problems requiring multi-step reasoning. It strengthens algebraic manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning over logic puzzles can reshape LLMs' internal reasoning, enabling more robust and compositional generalization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many supervised tasks but often
struggle with structured reasoning in unfamiliar settings. This discrepancy
suggests that standard fine-tuning pipelines may instill narrow,
domain-specific heuristics rather than fostering general-purpose thinking
strategies. In this work, we propose a "play to learn" framework that
fine-tunes LLMs through reinforcement learning on a suite of seven custom logic
puzzles, each designed to cultivate distinct reasoning skills such as
constraint propagation, spatial consistency, and symbolic deduction. Using a
reinforcement learning setup with verifiable rewards, models receive binary
feedback based on puzzle correctness, encouraging iterative, hypothesis-driven
problem solving. We demonstrate that this training approach significantly
improves out-of-distribution performance on a range of mathematical benchmarks,
especially for mid-difficulty problems that require multi-step reasoning.
Analyses across problem categories and difficulty levels reveal that puzzle
training promotes transferable reasoning routines, strengthening algebraic
manipulation, geometric inference, and combinatorial logic, while offering
limited gains on rote or highly specialized tasks. These findings show that
reinforcement learning over logic puzzles reshapes the internal reasoning of
LLMs, enabling more robust and compositional generalization without relying on
task-specific symbolic tools.

TL;DR: A novel method called EHR2Path is proposed to model patient pathways by converting EHR data into structured representations and predicting future health trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with limited feature spaces, ignoring complex longitudinal interactions for a comprehensive understanding of patient health.

Method: Transform EHR data into a structured representation and design a holistic pathway prediction model named EHR2Path.

Result: EHR2Path shows excellent performance in next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, surpassing competitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: This approach enables detailed patient trajectory simulations for diverse evaluation tasks, promoting predictive and personalized healthcare.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,
lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and
personalized healthcare.

### [205] [Sparse Autoencoders, Again?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04859)
*Yin Lu,Tong He,Xuening Zhu,David Wipf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new hybrid model for sparse autoencoders that overcomes limitations of previous models by combining deterministic and stochastic approaches. Theoretical analysis shows global minima can recover structured data, while empirical evaluations demonstrate improved performance on manifold dimension estimation and sparsity without sacrificing reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the widespread use of sparse autoencoders, there has been little innovation beyond the original method developed decades ago. This paper aims to address underappreciated weaknesses in traditional sparse autoencoders and variational autoencoders by proposing a novel hybrid model.

Method: The authors develop a hybrid model that combines deterministic and stochastic components, proving that its global minima can recover structured data across multiple manifolds. They also conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to validate the effectiveness of their approach.

Result: Empirical results show that the new model outperforms standard sparse autoencoders, variational autoencoders, and even some recent diffusion models in certain domains like image processing and language model activation patterns.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model offers significant improvements over existing methods for sparse autoencoding tasks, particularly in handling structured data across multiple manifolds while maintaining high levels of sparsity and accuracy.

Abstract: Is there really much more to say about sparse autoencoders (SAEs)?
Autoencoders in general, and SAEs in particular, represent deep architectures
that are capable of modeling low-dimensional latent structure in data. Such
structure could reflect, among other things, correlation patterns in large
language model activations, or complex natural image manifolds. And yet despite
the wide-ranging applicability, there have been relatively few changes to SAEs
beyond the original recipe from decades ago, namely, standard deep
encoder/decoder layers trained with a classical/deterministic sparse
regularizer applied within the latent space. One possible exception is the
variational autoencoder (VAE), which adopts a stochastic encoder module capable
of producing sparse representations when applied to manifold data. In this work
we formalize underappreciated weaknesses with both canonical SAEs, as well as
analogous VAEs applied to similar tasks, and propose a hybrid alternative model
that circumvents these prior limitations. In terms of theoretical support, we
prove that global minima of our proposed model recover certain forms of
structured data spread across a union of manifolds. Meanwhile, empirical
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets substantiate the efficacy of
our approach in accurately estimating underlying manifold dimensions and
producing sparser latent representations without compromising reconstruction
error. In general, we are able to exceed the performance of equivalent-capacity
SAEs and VAEs, as well as recent diffusion models where applicable, within
domains such as images and language model activation patterns.

*Antonio Almudévar,José Miguel Hernández-Lobato,Sameer Khurana,Ricard Marxer,Alfonso Ortega*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of ineffective contrastive losses in learning aligned multimodal representation spaces by introducing a new regularization term.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive losses are not effective in learning an aligned representation space due to the presence of modality-specific information.

Method: Theoretical analysis using Information Bottleneck Principle and proposing a regularization term in the loss function derived by variational approximation.

Result: Improved representational alignment in both controlled experiments and real-world applications.

Conclusion: The proposed regularization term can effectively reduce modality-specific information and improve the alignment of multimodal representation spaces.

Abstract: Contrastive losses have been extensively used as a tool for multimodal
representation learning. However, it has been empirically observed that their
use is not effective to learn an aligned representation space. In this paper,
we argue that this phenomenon is caused by the presence of modality-specific
information in the representation space. Although some of the most widely used
contrastive losses maximize the mutual information between representations of
both modalities, they are not designed to remove the modality-specific
information. We give a theoretical description of this problem through the lens
of the Information Bottleneck Principle. We also empirically analyze how
different hyperparameters affect the emergence of this phenomenon in a
controlled experimental setup. Finally, we propose a regularization term in the
loss function that is derived by means of a variational approximation and aims
to increase the representational alignment. We analyze in a set of controlled
experiments and real-world applications the advantages of including this
regularization term.

TL;DR: Propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) to enhance interpretability and validity of deep learning representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, hindering their deployment in sensitive applications.

Method: Introduce an Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.

Result: MCBMs support concept-level interventions with theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer greater flexibility in key design choices.

Conclusion: Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs) improve the reliability and validity of concept-based interpretations and interventions.

Abstract: Deep learning representations are often difficult to interpret, which can
hinder their deployment in sensitive applications. Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) have emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue by learning
representations that support target task performance while ensuring that each
component predicts a concrete concept from a predefined set. In this work, we
argue that CBMs do not impose a true bottleneck: the fact that a component can
predict a concept does not guarantee that it encodes only information about
that concept. This shortcoming raises concerns regarding interpretability and
the validity of intervention procedures. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Minimal Concept Bottleneck Models (MCBMs), which incorporate an
Information Bottleneck (IB) objective to constrain each representation
component to retain only the information relevant to its corresponding concept.
This IB is implemented via a variational regularization term added to the
training loss. As a result, MCBMs support concept-level interventions with
theoretical guarantees, remain consistent with Bayesian principles, and offer
greater flexibility in key design choices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents a method called Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM) for semi-automated classification of hip dysplasia using volumetric CT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia is crucial to prevent hip osteoarthritis, but current methods are time-consuming and rely on manual measurements.

Method: The authors combine Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, and tested it on 192 CT scans.

Result: The GPDSSM showed higher classification accuracy than angle-based methods and can save time for clinicians.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an effective tool for early diagnosis of hip dysplasia.

Abstract: Dysplasia is a recognised risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip,
early diagnosis of dysplasia is important to provide opportunities for surgical
interventions aimed at reducing the risk of hip OA. We have developed a
pipeline for semi-automated classification of dysplasia using volumetric CT
scans of patients' hips and a minimal set of clinically annotated landmarks,
combining the framework of the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model with
diffeomorphism to create a statistical shape model, which we termed the
Gaussian Process Diffeomorphic Statistical Shape Model (GPDSSM). We used 192 CT
scans, 100 for model training and 92 for testing. The GPDSSM effectively
distinguishes dysplastic samples from controls while also highlighting regions
of the underlying surface that show dysplastic variations. As well as improving
classification accuracy compared to angle-based methods (AUC 96.2% vs 91.2%),
the GPDSSM can save time for clinicians by removing the need to manually
measure angles and interpreting 2D scans for possible markers of dysplasia.

It also explores ways to improve data usage and addresses instability in reasoning model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in training long-context reasoning models.

Method: Systematic analysis of positive and negative samples, exploration of strategies to improve data efficiency in group relative policy optimization, and investigation into the causes of unstable performance across reasoning models and benchmarks.

Result: Training solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance, two strategies were found to enhance reasoning efficiency and capability, and multiple evaluation runs mitigate instability in reasoning model performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the roles of positive and negative samples in reinforcement learning and offers strategies to improve data efficiency and model stability in long-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training long-context reasoning models via
reinforcement learning (RL), several open questions and counterintuitive
behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs

Result: ALFIA outperforms state-of-the-art tabular classifiers on the cw-24 benchmark with balanced precision-recall.

Conclusion: ALFIA provides a robust tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Abstract: Early identification of high-risk ICU patients is crucial for directing
limited medical resources. We introduce ALFIA (Adaptive Layer Fusion with
Intelligent Attention), a modular, attention-based architecture that jointly
trains LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters and an adaptive layer-weighting
mechanism to fuse multi-layer semantic features from a BERT backbone. Trained
on our rigorous cw-24 (CriticalWindow-24) benchmark, ALFIA surpasses
state-of-the-art tabular classifiers in AUPRC while preserving a balanced
precision-recall profile. The embeddings produced by ALFIA's fusion module,
capturing both fine-grained clinical cues and high-level concepts, enable
seamless pairing with GBDTs (CatBoost/LightGBM) as ALFIA-boost, and deep neuro
networks as ALFIA-nn, yielding additional performance gains. Our experiments
confirm ALFIA's superior early-warning performance, by operating directly on
routine clinical text, it furnishes clinicians with a convenient yet robust
tool for risk stratification and timely intervention in critical-care settings.

Conclusion: Confirms the potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable, intent-driven automation, despite data quality and explainability concerns.

Abstract: The recent development of Agentic AI systems, empowered by autonomous large
language models (LLMs) agents with planning and tool-usage capabilities,
enables new possibilities for the evolution of industrial automation and
reduces the complexity introduced by Industry 4.0. This work proposes a
conceptual framework that integrates Agentic AI with the intent-based paradigm,
originally developed in network research, to simplify human-machine interaction
(HMI) and better align automation systems with the human-centric, sustainable,
and resilient principles of Industry 5.0. Based on the intent-based processing,
the framework allows human operators to express high-level business or
operational goals in natural language, which are decomposed into actionable
components. These intents are broken into expectations, conditions, targets,
context, and information that guide sub-agents equipped with specialized tools
to execute domain-specific tasks. A proof of concept was implemented using the
CMAPSS dataset and Google Agent Developer Kit (ADK), demonstrating the
feasibility of intent decomposition, agent orchestration, and autonomous
decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios. The results confirm the
potential of this approach to reduce technical barriers and enable scalable,

### [212] [FPTQuant: Function-Preserving Transforms for LLM Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04985)
*Boris van Breugel,Yelysei Bondarenko,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPTQuant introduces four new methods to help make transformers more efficient when using less precise numbers (quantization). It doesn't need special programming tricks and works well with existing models, showing great improvement in speed without much loss in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make large language models more energy-efficient during inference by improving quantization techniques.

Method: Introducing four function-preserving transforms: pre-RoPE for queries/keys, value transform, MLP scaling transform, and dynamic scaling transform.

Result: Static INT4 quantization with minimal overhead and up to 3.9 times speed-up over FP. Excellent accuracy-speed trade-off.

Conclusion: FPTQuant improves efficiency of transformers through effective quantization without significant loss in performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require substantial compute, and thus energy, at
inference time. While quantizing weights and activations is effective at
improving efficiency, naive quantization of LLMs can significantly degrade
performance due to large magnitude outliers. This paper describes FPTQuant,
which introduces four novel, lightweight, and expressive function-preserving
transforms (FPTs) to facilitate quantization of transformers: (1) a mergeable
pre-RoPE transform for queries and keys, (2) a mergeable transform for values,
(3) a mergeable scaling transform within the MLP block, and (4) a cheap,
dynamic scaling transform. By leveraging the equivariances and independencies
inherent to canonical transformer operation, we designed these FPTs to maintain
the model's function while shaping the intermediate activation distributions to
be more quantization friendly. FPTQuant requires no custom kernels and adds
virtually no overhead during inference. The FPTs are trained both locally to
reduce outliers, and end-to-end such that the outputs of the quantized and
full-precision models match. FPTQuant enables static INT4 quantization with
minimal overhead and shows SOTA speed-up of up to 3.9 times over FP.
Empirically, FPTQuant has an excellent accuracy-speed trade-off -- it is
performing on par or exceeding most prior work and only shows slightly lower
accuracy compared to a method that is up to 29% slower.

### [213] [Cautious Optimism: A Meta-Algorithm for Near-Constant Regret in General Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05005)
*Ashkan Soleymani,Georgios Piliouras,Gabriele Farina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces 'Cautious Optimism', a framework that accelerates no-regret learning in general games without relying on monotonic step-sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not an isolated phenomenon.

Method: Cautious Optimism takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Cautious Optimistic FTRL achieves near-optimal O_T(log T) regret in diverse self-play while preserving the optimal O(√T) regret in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: Introduces 'Cautious Optimism', a framework that accelerates no-regret learning in general games.

Abstract: Recent work [Soleymani et al., 2025] introduced a variant of Optimistic
Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) that adaptively controls the learning
pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner, achieving new state-of-the-art regret
minimization guarantees in general games. In this work, we demonstrate that
no-regret learning acceleration through adaptive pacing of the learners is not
an isolated phenomenon. We introduce \emph{Cautious Optimism}, a framework for
substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism
takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs
an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm by pacing the underlying FTRL with
minimal computational overhead. Importantly, we retain uncoupledness (learners
do not need to know other players' utilities). Cautious Optimistic FTRL
achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play
(mixing-and-matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O(\sqrt{T})$
regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g. Syrgkanis et
al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic
step-sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games.

### [214] [Towards Reasonable Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05014)
*Nektarios Kalampalikis,Kavya Gupta,Georgi Vitanov,Isabel Valera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Propose CREAM, a new family of Concept Bottleneck Models that encode concept relationships and use a regularized side-channel for competitive task performance and high concept importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enforce desired model reasoning and improve task performance while maintaining high concept importance.

Method: Embed directed and bidirected concept-concept and concept to task relationships, and integrate a regularized side-channel to encourage task predictions to be grounded in relevant concepts.

Result: CREAM achieves task performance on par with black-box models and the embedded relationships ease model interventions and mitigate concept leakage.

Conclusion: CREAM is a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models that can achieve competitive task performance while maintaining high concept importance and facilitating model interventions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose $\textbf{C}$oncept $\textbf{REA}$soning
$\textbf{M}$odels (CREAM), a novel family of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
that: (i) explicitly encodes concept-concept (${\texttt{C-C}}$) and
concept-task (${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$) relationships to enforce a desired
model reasoning; and (ii) use a regularized side-channel to achieve competitive
task performance, while keeping high concept importance. Specifically, CREAM
architecturally embeds (bi)directed concept-concept, and concept to task
relationships specified by a human expert, while severing undesired information
flows (e.g., to handle mutually exclusive concepts). Moreover, CREAM integrates
a black-box side-channel that is regularized to encourage task predictions to
be grounded in the relevant concepts, thereby utilizing the side-channel only
when necessary to enhance performance. Our experiments show that: (i) CREAM
mainly relies on concepts while achieving task performance on par with
black-box models; and (ii) the embedded ${\texttt{C-C}}$ and
${\texttt{C$\rightarrow$Y}}$ relationships ease model interventions and
mitigate concept leakage.

*John Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiPoint Proximity (MPP) encoding, an effective method for representing vector-mode geospatial data for use in machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable the use of vector-mode geospatial data in traditional machine learning and AI models by encoding it into an appropriate form.

Method: An encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a set of reference points within a region of interest.

Result: MPP encoding can differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features and capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision.

Conclusion: MPP encoding performs better than an alternative method based on rasterization and possesses desirable properties such as shape-centricity and continuity.

Abstract: Vector-mode geospatial data -- points, lines, and polygons -- must be encoded
into an appropriate form in order to be used with traditional machine learning
and artificial intelligence models. Encoding methods attempt to represent a
given shape as a vector that captures its essential geometric properties. This
paper presents an encoding method based on scaled distances from a shape to a
set of reference points within a region of interest. The method, MultiPoint
Proximity (MPP) encoding, can be applied to any type of shape, enabling the
parameterization of machine learning models with encoded representations of
vector-mode geospatial features. We show that MPP encoding possesses the
desirable properties of shape-centricity and continuity, can be used to
differentiate spatial objects based on their geometric features, and can
capture pairwise spatial relationships with high precision. In all cases, MPP
encoding is shown to perform better than an alternative method based on
rasterization.

### [216] [Tuning the Right Foundation Models is What you Need for Partial Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05027)
*Kuang He,Wei Tang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This study evaluates various partial label learning approaches on foundation models and proposes PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework. It finds that using foundation models leads to significant performance gains and that these approaches show similar performance across different ambiguity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more generalizable partial label learning models by evaluating existing approaches on foundation models.

Method: Comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8 benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. Proposed PartialCLIP, an efficient fine-tuning framework.

Result: Current PLL approaches achieve significant performance gains with foundation models, exhibit similar performance to each other, maintain stable performance across ambiguity levels, and are influenced by foundation model selection and adaptation strategies. Text-embedding classifier initialization and candidate label filtering using zero-shot CLIP are also effective.

Conclusion: Current PLL approaches have limitations which can be addressed to develop more generalizable models.

Abstract: Partial label learning (PLL) seeks to train generalizable classifiers from
datasets with inexact supervision, a common challenge in real-world
applications. Existing studies have developed numerous approaches to
progressively refine and recover ground-truth labels by training convolutional
neural networks. However, limited attention has been given to foundation models
that offer transferrable representations. In this work, we empirically conduct
comprehensive evaluations of 11 foundation models across 13 PLL approaches on 8
benchmark datasets under 3 PLL scenarios. We further propose PartialCLIP, an
efficient fine-tuning framework for foundation models in PLL. Our findings
reveal that current PLL approaches tend to 1) achieve significant performance
gains when using foundation models, 2) exhibit remarkably similar performance
to each other, 3) maintain stable performance across varying ambiguity levels,
while 4) are susceptible to foundation model selection and adaptation
strategies. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of text-embedding
classifier initialization and effective candidate label filtering using
zero-shot CLIP. Our experimental results and analysis underscore the
limitations of current PLL approaches and provide valuable insights for
developing more generalizable PLL models. The source code can be found at

### [217] [Identifying and Understanding Cross-Class Features in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05032)
*Zeming Wei,Yiwen Guo,Yisen Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new way of looking at adversarial training by focusing on class-wise feature attribution, identifying the role of cross-class features and their influence on robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the training mechanisms and dynamics of adversarial training, especially how different types of features affect robustness.

Method: Analyzing the impact of cross-class features on adversarial training through theoretical evidence and systematic studies across various model architectures.

Result: During the initial stages of adversarial training, models tend to learn more cross-class features leading to optimal robustness. As training progresses, the reliance shifts towards class-specific features.

Conclusion: This study provides deeper insights into adversarial training mechanisms and offers new perspectives for future research.

Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) has been considered one of the most effective
methods for making deep neural networks robust against adversarial attacks,
while the training mechanisms and dynamics of AT remain open research problems.
In this paper, we present a novel perspective on studying AT through the lens
of class-wise feature attribution. Specifically, we identify the impact of a
key family of features on AT that are shared by multiple classes, which we call
cross-class features. These features are typically useful for robust
classification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a
synthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model
architectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the
model tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness
checkpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust
overfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific
features. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two
existing properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and
robust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of
AT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them. Our code is

### [218] [TIMING: Temporality-Aware Integrated Gradients for Time Series Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05035)
*Hyeongwon Jang,Changhun Kim,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces TIMING, an enhanced method based on Integrated Gradients (IG) for explaining time series data, which incorporates temporal awareness to improve the identification of significant points with both positive and negative impacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional IG methods can identify important points in time series data but are limited by current evaluation metrics that fail to assess their capability. Existing methods also overlook the directional impact on predictions and may generate suboptimal results due to ignoring temporal relationships.

Method: The paper proposes two novel evaluation metrics - Cumulative Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP) - to better assess the performance of attribution methods. It also introduces TIMING, which improves IG by incorporating temporal awareness while preserving its theoretical properties.

Result: TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TIMING provides a more effective way to explain time series data by addressing the limitations of current methods and improving the identification of significant points with both positive and negative impacts.

Abstract: Recent explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods for time series
primarily estimate point-wise attribution magnitudes, while overlooking the
directional impact on predictions, leading to suboptimal identification of
significant points. Our analysis shows that conventional Integrated Gradients
(IG) effectively capture critical points with both positive and negative
impacts on predictions. However, current evaluation metrics fail to assess this
capability, as they inadvertently cancel out opposing feature contributions. To
address this limitation, we propose novel evaluation metrics-Cumulative
Prediction Difference (CPD) and Cumulative Prediction Preservation (CPP)-to
systematically assess whether attribution methods accurately identify
significant positive and negative points in time series XAI. Under these
metrics, conventional IG outperforms recent counterparts. However, directly
applying IG to time series data may lead to suboptimal outcomes, as generated
paths ignore temporal relationships and introduce out-of-distribution samples.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce TIMING, which enhances IG by
incorporating temporal awareness while maintaining its theoretical properties.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series benchmarks
demonstrate that TIMING outperforms existing time series XAI baselines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/drumpt/TIMING.

Method: We propose inductive node2vec (iN2V), which combines a post-hoc procedure to compute embeddings for nodes unseen during training and modifications to the original N2V training procedure to prepare the embeddings for this post-hoc procedure.

Result: We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that iN2V is an effective approach to bringing transductive embeddings to an inductive setting. Using iN2V embeddings improves node classification by 1 point on average, with up to 6 points of improvement depending on the dataset and the number of unseen nodes.

Conclusion: Our iN2V is a plug-in approach to create new or enrich existing embeddings. It can also be combined with other embedding methods, making it a versatile approach for inductive node representation learning.

Abstract: Shallow node embeddings like node2vec (N2V) can be used for nodes without

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring for models in dynamic environments without labels. It proposes D3M, a monitoring algorithm that achieves low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a solution for knowing when to retrain models in dynamic environments without access to labels, as some shifts degrade model performance while others do not.

Method: The method proposed is D3M, which is based on the disagreement of predictive models.

Result: Empirical results show the effectiveness of the framework and highlight its potential as an alert mechanism for high-stakes machine learning pipelines.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that D3M is a practical and efficient monitoring algorithm for PDD.

Abstract: The distribution of data changes over time; models operating operating in
dynamic environments need retraining. But knowing when to retrain, without
access to labels, is an open challenge since some, but not all shifts degrade
model performance. This paper formalizes and addresses the problem of
post-deployment deterioration (PDD) monitoring. We propose D3M, a practical and
efficient monitoring algorithm based on the disagreement of predictive models,
achieving low false positive rates under non-deteriorating shifts and provides
sample complexity bounds for high true positive rates under deteriorating
shifts. Empirical results on both standard benchmark and a real-world
large-scale internal medicine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
framework and highlight its viability as an alert mechanism for high-stakes
machine learning pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces NIMO, a model that combines neural networks and linear models to maintain interpretability while enhancing predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the advantages of neural networks and linear models, particularly the interpretability of linear models and the expressiveness of neural networks.

Method: The NN learns nonlinear corrections to linear model predictions, with an optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that updates linear coefficients analytically.

Result: Empirically, we recover underlying linear coefficients and improve predictive accuracy. Our model outperforms other hybrid interpretable approaches in terms of performance across regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: We introduce NIMO, a novel model that combines the benefits of neural networks and linear models, maintaining interpretability while improving predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) have achieved tremendous success over the past decade,
yet they are still extremely difficult to interpret. In contrast, linear models
are less expressive but offer inherent interpretability. Linear coefficients
are interpretable as the marginal effect of a feature on the prediction,
assuming all other features are kept fixed. To combine the benefits of both
approaches, we introduce NIMO (Nonlinear Interpretable MOdel). The key idea is
to define a model where the NN is designed to learn nonlinear corrections to
the linear model predictions, while also maintaining the original
interpretability of the linear coefficients. Relevantly, we develop an
optimization algorithm based on profile likelihood that elegantly allows for
optimizing over the NN parameters while updating the linear coefficients
analytically. By relying on adaptive ridge regression we can easily incorporate
sparsity constraints as well. We show empirically that we can recover the
underlying linear coefficients while significantly improving the predictive
accuracy. Compared to other hybrid interpretable approaches, our model is the
only one that actually maintains the same interpretability of linear
coefficients as in linear models. We also achieve higher performance on various
regression and classification settings.

TL;DR: This paper extends the HiPPO theory to handle measurement noise in state space models, deriving an uncertainty-aware initialization method that improves noise resistance during training and inference without increasing runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HiPPO framework assumes noise-free data, which is often violated in practical scenarios.

Method: Extends HiPPO theory by reformulating it as a linear stochastic control problem with noisy data outputs, deriving an alternative dynamics initialization method.

Result: Proposed initialization method improves state-space models' resistance to noise at training and inference times.

Conclusion: Successfully extended HiPPO framework to handle measurement noise and provided an uncertainty-aware initialization method for state space model dynamics.

Abstract: State space models are emerging as a dominant model class for sequence
problems with many relying on the HiPPO framework to initialize their dynamics.
However, HiPPO fundamentally assumes data to be noise-free; an assumption often
violated in practice. We extend the HiPPO theory with measurement noise and
derive an uncertainty-aware initialization for state space model dynamics. In
our analysis, we interpret HiPPO as a linear stochastic control problem where
the data enters as a noise-free control signal. We then reformulate the problem
so that the data become noisy outputs of a latent system and arrive at an
alternative dynamics initialization that infers the posterior of this latent
system from the data without increasing runtime. Our experiments show that our
initialization improves the resistance of state-space models to noise both at
training and inference time. Find our implementation at

TL;DR: Propose a kernelized KL divergence estimator for stabilizing training through nonparametric smoothing and introduce an importance sampling correction to reduce bias. Provide theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational gradient descent and show that the semi-implicit approach achieves lower gradient variance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and bias in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Kernelized KL divergence estimator with nonparametric smoothing and importance sampling correction.

Result: Outperforms or matches state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method leads to more stable and efficient optimization.

Abstract: Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) is a powerful framework for
approximating complex posterior distributions, but training with the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence can be challenging due to high variance and
bias in high-dimensional settings. While current state-of-the-art semi-implicit
variational inference methods, particularly Kernel Semi-Implicit Variational
Inference (KSIVI), have been shown to work in high dimensions, training remains
moderately expensive. In this work, we propose a kernelized KL divergence
estimator that stabilizes training through nonparametric smoothing. To further
reduce the bias, we introduce an importance sampling correction. We provide a
theoretical connection to the amortized version of the Stein variational
gradient descent, which estimates the score gradient via Stein's identity,
showing that both methods minimize the same objective, but our semi-implicit
approach achieves lower gradient variance. In addition, our method's bias in
function space is benign, leading to more stable and efficient optimization.
Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms or matches
state-of-the-art SIVI methods in both performance and training efficiency.

*Clément Pierquin,Aurélien Bellet,Marc Tommasi,Matthieu Boussard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the privacy implications of synthetic data in linear regression, demonstrating both privacy risks and benefits depending on how the data is generated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of rigorous theoretical understanding regarding the privacy benefits of synthetic data.

Method: The study uses linear regression as a framework to explore the relationship between synthetic data generation and privacy.

Result: Negative results show that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single synthetic data point can reveal as much information as releasing the model itself. Positive results indicate that generating synthetic data from random inputs can amplify privacy when a limited number of points are released.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the privacy guarantees of synthetic data depend on how it is generated, and releasing a controlled number of synthetic data points can enhance privacy.

Abstract: Synthetic data inherits the differential privacy guarantees of the model used
to generate it. Additionally, synthetic data may benefit from privacy
amplification when the generative model is kept hidden. While empirical studies
suggest this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical understanding is still lacking.
In this paper, we investigate this question through the well-understood
framework of linear regression. First, we establish negative results showing
that if an adversary controls the seed of the generative model, a single
synthetic data point can leak as much information as releasing the model
itself. Conversely, we show that when synthetic data is generated from random
inputs, releasing a limited number of synthetic data points amplifies privacy
beyond the model's inherent guarantees. We believe our findings in linear
regression can serve as a foundation for deriving more general bounds in the
future.

Conclusion: 在关联记忆学习景观和扩散模型的学习及生成景观中，在零噪声极限下除了孤立点外的所有点上都具有稳定性，并且给出了经典和现代Hopfield网络（等效于注意力机制）的结构稳定性标准。

Abstract: Connections between generative diffusion and continuous-state associative
memory models are studied. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are emphasized as
universal approximators of gradient-based associative memory models and
diffusion models as white-noise perturbed systems thereof. Universal properties
of associative memory that follow from this description are described and used
to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise levels
diminish. Structural stability inherited by Morse-Smale flows is shown to imply
a notion of stability for diffusions at vanishing noise levels. Applied to one-
and two-parameter families of gradients, this indicates stability at all but
isolated points of associative memory learning landscapes and the learning and
generation landscapes of diffusion models with gradient drift in the zero-noise
limit, at which small sets of generic bifurcations characterize qualitative
transitions between stable systems. Examples illustrating the characterization
of these landscapes by sequences of these bifurcations are given, along with
structural stability criterion for classic and modern Hopfield networks
(equivalently, the attention mechanism).

*Zhicheng Yang,Zhijiang Guo,Yinya Huang,Xiaodan Liang,Yiwei Wang,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method named TreeRPO improves the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models by providing fine-grained and dense reward signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods lack sufficient guidance for intermediate steps in the reasoning process.

Method: TreeRPO estimates reward expectations at various reasoning steps using tree sampling and computes rewards based on step-level groups.

Result: TreeRPO improved Pass@1 accuracy from 19.0% to 35.5% and outperformed GRPO by 2.9% while reducing response length by 18.1%.

Conclusion: TreeRPO enhances the learning process and overall performance of LLMs effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods. However,
a key limitation of existing approaches is that rewards defined at the full
trajectory level provide insufficient guidance for optimizing the intermediate
steps of a reasoning process. To address this, we introduce \textbf{\name}, a
novel method that estimates the mathematical expectations of rewards at various
reasoning steps using tree sampling. Unlike prior methods that rely on a
separate step reward model, \name directly estimates these rewards through this
sampling process. Building on the group-relative reward training mechanism of
GRPO, \name innovatively computes rewards based on step-level groups generated
during tree sampling. This advancement allows \name to produce fine-grained and

TL;DR: Propose a new method called LPMT to improve diffusion-based re-ranking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positive signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source in diffusion-based re-ranking methods, reducing discriminative power beyond local regions.

Method: Introduce Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion (BCD) and Locality State Embedding (LSE) to integrate diffusion processes and encode instances, then connect these distributions via the Thermodynamic Markovian Transition (TMT) process.

Result: Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed LPMT framework improves the discriminative power of diffusion-based re-ranking methods by preserving locality and maintaining global consistency.

Abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking methods are effective in modeling the data
manifolds through similarity propagation in affinity graphs. However, positive
signals tend to diminish over several steps away from the source, reducing
discriminative power beyond local regions. To address this issue, we introduce
the Locality Preserving Markovian Transition (LPMT) framework, which employs a
long-term thermodynamic transition process with multiple states for accurate
manifold distance measurement. The proposed LPMT first integrates diffusion
processes across separate graphs using Bidirectional Collaborative Diffusion
(BCD) to establish strong similarity relationships. Afterwards, Locality State
Embedding (LSE) encodes each instance into a distribution for enhanced local
consistency. These distributions are interconnected via the Thermodynamic
Markovian Transition (TMT) process, enabling efficient global retrieval while
maintaining local effectiveness. Experimental results across diverse tasks
confirm the effectiveness of LPMT for instance retrieval.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型有能力在推理时使用提示中的少量输入-输出示例执行新任务，而无需任何微调或参数更新。

Conclusion: 本研究通过开发一种通用近似理论来更好地理解变换器如何实现上下文学习。实验表明，无需进一步权重更新，变换器可以可靠地预测仅给定少量上下文示例。

Abstract: Modern large language models are capable of in-context learning, the ability
to perform new tasks at inference time using only a handful of input-output
examples in the prompt, without any fine-tuning or parameter updates. We
develop a universal approximation theory to better understand how transformers
enable in-context learning. For any class of functions (each representing a
distinct task), we demonstrate how to construct a transformer that, without any
further weight updates, can perform reliable prediction given only a few
in-context examples. In contrast to much of the recent literature that frames
transformers as algorithm approximators -- i.e., constructing transformers to
emulate the iterations of optimization algorithms as a means to approximate
solutions of learning problems -- our work adopts a fundamentally different
approach rooted in universal function approximation. This alternative approach
offers approximation guarantees that are not constrained by the effectiveness
of the optimization algorithms being approximated, thereby extending far beyond
convex problems and linear function classes. Our construction sheds light on
how transformers can simultaneously learn general-purpose representations and
adapt dynamically to in-context examples.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces the HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework to reduce degree bias in GNNs for node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Degree bias in GNNs leads to varying prediction performance across nodes with different degrees. Existing GCL approaches still result in low-degree nodes getting insufficient and noisy information.

Method: HAR contrastive loss is proposed to add more positive pairs using node labels and adaptively weight positive and negative pairs based on their learning hardness. SHARP framework is developed to extend HAR to broader scenarios.

Result: SHARP shows better performance than baselines at both global and degree levels across four datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed HAR contrastive loss and SHARP framework effectively mitigate degree bias in GNNs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm is proposed within the RKHS framework using a connected graph-represented networked system. This method offers a unified framework for robust regression different from existing distributed schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel decentralized learning algorithm that can handle robust regression problems more effectively than current distributed methods.

Method: Utilizing a networked system represented as a connected graph, the algorithm incorporates a robust loss function induced by a windowing function and a robustness scaling parameter.

Result: The algorithm achieves optimal learning rates in various norms under proper selection of step size and scaling parameter, with each local robust estimator being able to approximate the regression function.

Conclusion: This decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm provides a unified framework for robust regression, highlighting the importance of the robustness scaling parameter in achieving favorable convergence behavior.

Abstract: We propose a new decentralized robust kernel-based learning algorithm within
the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) by utilizing a
networked system that can be represented as a connected graph. The robust loss
function $\mathcal{L}_\sigma$ induced by a windowing function $W$ and a
robustness scaling parameter $\sigma>0$, can encompass a broad spectrum of
robust losses. Consequently, the proposed algorithm effectively provides a
unified decentralized learning framework for robust regression, which
fundamentally differs from the existing distributed robust kernel learning
schemes, all of which are divide-and-conquer based. We rigorously establish the
learning theory and offer a comprehensive convergence analysis for the
algorithm. We show each local robust estimator generated from the decentralized
algorithm can be utilized to approximate the regression function. Based on
kernel-based integral operator techniques, we derive general high confidence
convergence bounds for each local approximating sequence in terms of the mean
square distance, RKHS norm, and generalization error, respectively. Moreover,
we provide rigorous selection rules for local sample size and show that, under
properly selected step size and scaling parameter $\sigma$, the decentralized
robust algorithm can achieve optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors)
in both norms. The parameter $\sigma$ is shown to be essential for enhancing
robustness while also ensuring favorable convergence behavior. The intrinsic
connection among decentralization, sample selection, robustness of the
algorithm, and its convergence is clearly reflected.

Motivation: 为了解决计算精确Shapley值困难的问题，许多模型无关的随机估计器被开发出来，但KernelSHAP的理论保证一直难以获得。

Method: 描述了一个包含KernelSHAP及相关估计器的广义统一框架，并证明了非渐近理论保证。

Result: 在小到中等维度的数据集上，该方法相对于精确Shapley值验证了其低均方误差。此外，在MNIST和CIFAR10等高维数据集上测试时，该方法表现优于KernelSHAP库。

Conclusion: 这是迄今为止对KernelSHAP的第一个理论保证，同时通过实施特定改进使方法能够处理高维数据集。

Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features
impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact
Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature
dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic
randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used
being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg & Lee, 2017). While related estimators
such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert & Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &
Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for
KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework
that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with
and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our
framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical
guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing
estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional
datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact
Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest
sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to
enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods,
tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results
compared to the KernelSHAP library.

*Danil Sivtsov,Ivan Rodkin,Gleb Kuzmin,Yuri Kuratov,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching is a new scheduling scheme that allows parallel processing in Recurrent Memory Transformers (RMTs), significantly speeding up inference times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic time and linear memory complexity of transformer models limit their efficiency in long-context inference.

Method: Introducing Diagonal Batching to unlock parallelism in RMTs while maintaining exact recurrence.

Result: Achieved a 3.3x speedup over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential RMT implementation on large token sequences.

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching improves RMTs' efficiency, making them more suitable for real-world long-context applications.

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context
applications.

TL;DR: We propose Progressive Tempering Sampler with Diffusion (PTSD), which combines parallel tempering and diffusion models to improve the efficiency of sampling from unnormalized densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research has focused on designing neural samplers that amortize the process of sampling from unnormalized densities. However, despite significant advancements, they still fall short of the state-of-the-art MCMC approach, Parallel Tempering (PT), when it comes to the efficiency of target evaluations. Unlike a well-trained neural sampler, PT yields only dependent samples and needs to be rerun -- at considerable computational cost -- whenever new samples are required.

Method: Trains diffusion models sequentially across temperatures, leveraging the advantages of Parallel Tempering (PT) to improve the training of neural samplers. Introduces a novel method to combine high-temperature diffusion models to generate approximate lower-temperature samples, which are minimally refined using MCMC and used to train the next diffusion model.

Result: PTSD enables efficient reuse of sample information across temperature levels while generating well-mixed, uncorrelated samples.

Conclusion: Our method significantly improves target evaluation efficiency, outperforming diffusion-based neural samplers.

TL;DR: A new numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable version of the Mesa layer is introduced and studied in language modeling. It stems from an in-context loss minimized optimally at every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers dominate sequence modeling but have linear memory and compute costs during inference. Linearizing the softmax operation led to RNN models with constant costs.

Method: Introduces a new version of the Mesa layer with optimal in-context loss minimization using a conjugate gradient solver.

Result: The model achieves lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance than previous RNNs, particularly for tasks needing long context understanding.

Conclusion: Optimal test-time training enables better performance at the cost of more inference-time flops.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during
inference time. Our results are therefore intriguingly related to recent trends
of increasing test-time compute to improve performance -- here by spending
compute to solve sequential optimization problems within the neural network
itself.

TL;DR: This paper examines sparse autoencoders in MNIST and introduces a new multi-iteration method to better extract correlated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the ability of sparse autoencoders to extract correlated features in complex data structures.

Method: Introducing a multi-iteration sparse autoencoder based on Matching Pursuit.

Result: The proposed method can better extract correlated features while ensuring the reconstruction improves with each iteration.

Conclusion: The quasi-orthogonality assumption in current architectures is limiting and the proposed multi-iteration approach overcomes this.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become central tools for
interpretability, leveraging dictionary learning principles to extract sparse,
interpretable features from neural representations whose underlying structure
is typically unknown. This paper evaluates SAEs in a controlled setting using
MNIST, which reveals that current shallow architectures implicitly rely on a
quasi-orthogonality assumption that limits the ability to extract correlated
features. To move beyond this, we introduce a multi-iteration SAE by unrolling
Matching Pursuit (MP-SAE), enabling the residual-guided extraction of
correlated features that arise in hierarchical settings such as handwritten
digit generation while guaranteeing monotonic improvement of the reconstruction
as more atoms are selected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient method for aligning latent spaces with target distributions without computationally expensive operations.

Method: Pretraining a flow model on target features and using an alignment loss to regularize the latent space.

Result: The method approximates the negative log-likelihood of the target distribution and shows effectiveness in image generation experiments.

Conclusion: This framework provides a new approach for latent space alignment with both theoretical and empirical support.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for aligning learnable latent spaces to
arbitrary target distributions by leveraging flow-based generative models as
priors. Our method first pretrains a flow model on the target features to
capture the underlying distribution. This fixed flow model subsequently
regularizes the latent space via an alignment loss, which reformulates the flow
matching objective to treat the latents as optimization targets. We formally
prove that minimizing this alignment loss establishes a computationally
tractable surrogate objective for maximizing a variational lower bound on the
log-likelihood of latents under the target distribution. Notably, the proposed
method eliminates computationally expensive likelihood evaluations and avoids
ODE solving during optimization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate in a
controlled setting that the alignment loss landscape closely approximates the
negative log-likelihood of the target distribution. We further validate the
effectiveness of our approach through large-scale image generation experiments
on ImageNet with diverse target distributions, accompanied by detailed
discussions and ablation studies. With both theoretical and empirical
validation, our framework paves a new way for latent space alignment.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the convergence behavior of a single-layer Transformer model with self-attention, a feedforward network, and residual connections. It demonstrates linear convergence under appropriate initialization and shows that residual connections improve optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the training dynamics of Transformers is crucial despite their widespread use. The study aims to fill gaps in the theoretical understanding by examining interdependencies between components.

Method: Analyzing a structurally complete single-layer Transformer using gradient descent and examining the effects of residual connections on convergence.

Result: Linear convergence rate is achieved under proper initialization. Residual connections help alleviate issues caused by the softmax operation's low-rank structure.

Conclusion: Theoretical analysis and empirical results confirm the benefits of residual connections in enhancing convergence stability in Transformers.

Abstract: Transformer models have emerged as fundamental tools across various
scientific and engineering disciplines, owing to their outstanding performance
in diverse applications. Despite this empirical success, the theoretical
foundations of Transformers remain relatively underdeveloped, particularly in
understanding their training dynamics. Existing research predominantly examines
isolated components--such as self-attention mechanisms and feedforward
networks--without thoroughly investigating the interdependencies between these
components, especially when residual connections are present. In this paper, we
aim to bridge this gap by analyzing the convergence behavior of a structurally
complete yet single-layer Transformer, comprising self-attention, a feedforward
network, and residual connections. We demonstrate that, under appropriate
initialization, gradient descent exhibits a linear convergence rate, where the
convergence speed is determined by the minimum and maximum singular values of
the output matrix from the attention layer. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
residual connections serve to ameliorate the ill-conditioning of this output
matrix, an issue stemming from the low-rank structure imposed by the softmax
operation, thereby promoting enhanced optimization stability. We also extend
our theoretical findings to a multi-layer Transformer architecture, confirming
the linear convergence rate of gradient descent under suitable initialization.
Empirical results corroborate our theoretical insights, illustrating the
beneficial role of residual connections in promoting convergence stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop learning algorithms that follow physical principles for efficient simulation and design of dynamical systems.

Method: RHEL computes loss gradients using finite differences of physical trajectories of non-dissipative Hamiltonian systems without explicit Jacobian computation.

Result: RHEL demonstrates scalability by training Hamiltonian SSMs on time-series tasks up to sequence length of 50k, matching the performance of Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT).

Conclusion: This approach enables the creation of energy-efficient physical systems capable of self-learning for sequence modeling.

Abstract: Deep State Space Models (SSMs) reignite physics-grounded compute paradigms,
as RNNs could natively be embodied into dynamical systems. This calls for
dedicated learning algorithms obeying to core physical principles, with
efficient techniques to simulate these systems and guide their design. We
propose Recurrent Hamiltonian Echo Learning (RHEL), an algorithm which provably
computes loss gradients as finite differences of physical trajectories of
non-dissipative, Hamiltonian systems. In ML terms, RHEL only requires three
"forward passes" irrespective of model size, without explicit Jacobian
computation, nor incurring any variance in the gradient estimation. Motivated
by the physical realization of our algorithm, we first introduce RHEL in
continuous time and demonstrate its formal equivalence with the continuous
adjoint state method. To facilitate the simulation of Hamiltonian systems
trained by RHEL, we propose a discrete-time version of RHEL which is equivalent
to Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when applied to a class of recurrent
modules which we call Hamiltonian Recurrent Units (HRUs). This setting allows
us to demonstrate the scalability of RHEL by generalizing these results to
hierarchies of HRUs, which we call Hamiltonian SSMs (HSSMs). We apply RHEL to
train HSSMs with linear and nonlinear dynamics on a variety of time-series
tasks ranging from mid-range to long-range classification and regression with
sequence length reaching $\sim 50k$. We show that RHEL consistently matches the
performance of BPTT across all models and tasks. This work opens new doors for
the design of scalable, energy-efficient physical systems endowed with
self-learning capabilities for sequence modelling.

Motivation: To address the computational bottleneck caused by communication between agents in distributed learning and mitigate the degradation in convergence due to compressed communication.

Method: Tight analysis of error feedback schemes EF and EF^21 using a Lyapunov function to achieve the best possible convergence rates.

Result: Sharp performance guarantees for EF and EF^21, allowing for a rigorous comparison with compressed gradient descent.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of error feedback schemes in distributed learning.

Abstract: Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlling properties in generated time series sequences is challenging, and current methods struggle with both point-level and segment-level controls.

Method: The framework combines two mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical properties over segments.

Result: Experiments on diverse datasets and models show the effectiveness of the method.

Conclusion: CocktailEdit bridges the gap between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs, offering a flexible solution for human-in-the-loop time series generation and editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in time series generation have shown promise, yet controlling
properties in generated sequences remains challenging. Time Series Editing
(TSE) - making precise modifications while preserving temporal coherence -
consider both point-level constraints and segment-level controls that current
methods struggle to provide. We introduce the CocktailEdit framework to enable
simultaneous, flexible control across different types of constraints. This
framework combines two key mechanisms: a confidence-weighted anchor control for
point-wise constraints and a classifier-based control for managing statistical
properties such as sums and averages over segments. Our methods achieve precise
local control during the denoising inference stage while maintaining temporal
coherence and integrating seamlessly, with any conditionally trained
diffusion-based time series models. Extensive experiments across diverse
datasets and models demonstrate its effectiveness. Our work bridges the gap
between pure generative modeling and real-world time series editing needs,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational overhead of Shapley value-based methods for evaluating AI training data contributions.

Method: Introduces Fast-DataShapley, which uses weighted least squares and reduces training overhead through three methods with theoretical guarantees.

Result: Significantly improves performance and efficiency on image datasets, with performance enhanced more than 2.5 times and training speed increased by two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Fast-DataShapley offers a practical solution for fairly rewarding data contributors in the AI industry without the need for retraining for each test sample.

Abstract: The value and copyright of training data are crucial in the artificial
intelligence industry. Service platforms should protect data providers'
legitimate rights and fairly reward them for their contributions. Shapley
value, a potent tool for evaluating contributions, outperforms other methods in
theory, but its computational overhead escalates exponentially with the number
of data providers. Recent works based on Shapley values attempt to mitigate
computation complexity by approximation algorithms. However, they need to
retrain for each test sample, leading to intolerable costs. We propose
Fast-DataShapley, a one-pass training method that leverages the weighted least
squares characterization of the Shapley value to train a reusable explainer
model with real-time reasoning speed. Given new test samples, no retraining is
required to calculate the Shapley values of the training data. Additionally, we
propose three methods with theoretical guarantees to reduce training overhead
from two aspects: the approximate calculation of the utility function and the
group calculation of the training data. We analyze time complexity to show the
efficiency of our methods. The experimental evaluations on various image
datasets demonstrate superior performance and efficiency compared to baselines.
Specifically, the performance is improved to more than 2.5 times, and the
explainer's training speed can be increased by two orders of magnitude.

Motivation: To enable reservoir computing to generalize to unexplored regions of state space without explicit structural priors

Method: A multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers

Result: Reservoir computers trained on trajectories from a single basin of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

Conclusion: Reservoir computing can achieve out-of-domain generalization without explicit structural priors.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques offer an effective approach to modeling dynamical
systems solely from observed data. However, without explicit structural priors
-- built-in assumptions about the underlying dynamics -- these techniques
typically struggle to generalize to aspects of the dynamics that are poorly
represented in the training data. Here, we demonstrate that reservoir computing
-- a simple, efficient, and versatile machine learning framework often used for
data-driven modeling of dynamical systems -- can generalize to unexplored
regions of state space without explicit structural priors. First, we describe a
multiple-trajectory training scheme for reservoir computers that supports
training across a collection of disjoint time series, enabling effective use of
available training data. Then, applying this training scheme to multistable
dynamical systems, we show that RCs trained on trajectories from a single basin
of attraction can achieve out-of-domain generalization by capturing system
behavior in entirely unobserved basins.

*Arnav Kumar Jain,Vibhakar Mohta,Subin Kim,Atiksh Bhardwaj,Juntao Ren,Yunhai Feng,Sanjiban Choudhury,Gokul Swamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores Learning to Search (L2S) from expert demonstrations to enable agents to plan and recover from mistakes independently, even in unseen situations. The approach, named SAILOR, uses a world model and a reward model for stable and sample-efficient learning without extra human corrections. It outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies across multiple visual manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of behavioral cloning (BC), which only teaches agents what the expert did at visited states and lacks the ability to recover from mistakes.

Method: Learning to Search (L2S) using a world model and a reward model to plan and recover from mistakes independently.

Result: SAILOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Scaling up BC demonstrations does not close the performance gap.

Conclusion: SAILOR demonstrates robustness to reward hacking and identifies nuanced failures, offering a more effective approach for imitation learning.

Abstract: The fundamental limitation of the behavioral cloning (BC) approach to
imitation learning is that it only teaches an agent what the expert did at
states the expert visited. This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake
which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't
know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the
fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather
than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving
the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In
response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e.
learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert
outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2)
a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions
required to combine these and other components for stable and
sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional
human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three
benchmarks, our approach $\texttt{SAILOR}$ consistently out-performs
state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data.
Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by
5-10$\times$ still leaves a performance gap. We find that $\texttt{SAILOR}$ can
identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/arnavkj1995/SAILOR .

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides theoretical analysis of several test-time scaling strategies for large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies remains limited.

Method: Establishing a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies, presenting an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback.

Result: Self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$. Self-correction approach with verifier feedback enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical understandings of several test-time scaling strategies for LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success,
theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time
strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction --
remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between
two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires
$\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$
only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap
between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an
expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback:
it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at
test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve
multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a
user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from
single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our
theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of
self-correction methods.

*Nirav Koley,Prajwal Singhania,Abhinav Bhatele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We introduce SiftAttention, an efficient approximate attention method for large language models on GPUs that uses a threshold-based filtering instead of costly top-k operations, preserving model quality and reducing memory bandwidth usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory bandwidth limitations during data transfers between HBM and SRAM in attention computations for large language models on GPUs.

Method: Propose SiftAttention, which replaces the top-k step with an element-wise filtering operation based on a threshold value, dynamically estimated per prompt at each generation step.

Result: SiftAttention reduces memory bandwidth usage when loading value vectors and preserves model quality better than existing approximate attention methods.

Conclusion: SiftAttention provides a computationally efficient solution for approximate attention on GPUs, improving the efficiency of large language model inference.

Abstract: Efficient inference on GPUs using large language models remains challenging
due to memory bandwidth limitations, particularly during data transfers between
High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and SRAM in attention computations. Approximate
attention methods address this issue by reducing computational and memory
overhead but often rely on expensive top-$k$ operations, which perform poorly
on GPUs. We propose SiftAttention, a novel approximate attention method that
replaces the top-$k$ step with a computationally efficient element-wise
filtering operation based on a threshold value. Our intuition for doing this is
based on our empirical observation that the $\tau$-th quantile of attention
scores follows a predictable power-law over sequential generation steps.
Exploiting this insight, our approach dynamically estimates a threshold value
per prompt at each generation step. Only attention scores above this threshold
and their corresponding value vectors are loaded/used to compute the attention
output, reducing data movement between HBM and SRAM. Our evaluation
demonstrates that SiftAttention preserves model quality better than existing
approximate attention methods while reducing memory bandwidth usage when
loading value vectors.

*Florentin Guth,Zahra Kadkhodaie,Eero P Simoncelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for learning normalized energy models based on diffusion generative models, demonstrating strong generalization and significant variations in image probability and neighborhood dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty of learning probability models due to the curse of dimensionality by introducing a novel framework.

Method: A modified score network architecture computes an energy while preserving inductive biases. The energy network's gradient with respect to its input image is used as the score of the learned density, optimized using a denoising objective. An additional score derived from the gradient with respect to the noise level is optimized with a secondary objective.

Result: The trained energy network achieves a cross-entropy value comparable to the state of the art on the ImageNet64 dataset. The energy model strongly generalizes, with estimated log probabilities being nearly independent of the specific images in the training set.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that image probability and neighborhood dimensions vary significantly with image content, challenging traditional assumptions.

Abstract: Learning probability models from data is at the heart of many machine
learning endeavors, but is notoriously difficult due to the curse of
dimensionality. We introduce a new framework for learning \emph{normalized}
energy (log probability) models that is inspired from diffusion generative
models, which rely on networks optimized to estimate the score. We modify a
score network architecture to compute an energy while preserving its inductive
biases. The gradient of this energy network with respect to its input image is
the score of the learned density, which can be optimized using a denoising
objective. Importantly, the gradient with respect to the noise level provides
an additional score that can be optimized with a novel secondary objective,
ensuring consistent and normalized energies across noise levels. We train an
energy network with this \emph{dual} score matching objective on the ImageNet64
dataset, and obtain a cross-entropy (negative log likelihood) value comparable
to the state of the art. We further validate our approach by showing that our
energy model \emph{strongly generalizes}: estimated log probabilities are
nearly independent of the specific images in the training set. Finally, we
demonstrate that both image probability and dimensionality of local
neighborhoods vary significantly with image content, in contrast with
traditional assumptions such as concentration of measure or support on a
low-dimensional manifold.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces two techniques - difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay - to enhance data efficiency in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high resource-intensity and low data efficiency of existing reinforcement learning fine-tuning methods.

Method: Proposes difficulty-targeted online data selection guided by adaptive difficulty and a rollout replay mechanism to reuse recent rollouts.

Result: Reduces reinforcement learning fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% compared to the original GRPO algorithm across six LLM-dataset combinations.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve data efficiency in reinforcement learning fine-tuning of large language models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: LSM-2 with AIM is a new SSL approach that can learn robust representations directly from incomplete data without explicit imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models rely on complete and well-structured data, but wearable sensor data often has missingness which poses a challenge for SSL models.

Method: Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM) uses learnable mask tokens to model existing and artificial missingness.

Result: LSM-2 with AIM pre-trained on 40M hours of sensor data performs well across different tasks and scales better than previous models.

Conclusion: LSM-2 with AIM is a reliable option for real-world wearable data applications, especially under targeted missingness scenarios.

Abstract: Foundation models, a cornerstone of recent advancements in machine learning,
have predominantly thrived on complete and well-structured data. Wearable
sensor data frequently suffers from significant missingness, posing a
substantial challenge for self-supervised learning (SSL) models that typically
assume complete data inputs. This paper introduces the second generation of
Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel
SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data
without requiring explicit imputation. AIM's core novelty lies in its use of
learnable mask tokens to model both existing ("inherited") and artificially
introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world
data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of
day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best
performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification,
regression and generative modeling. Furthermore, LSM-2 with AIM exhibits
superior scaling performance, and critically, maintains high performance even
under targeted missingness scenarios, reflecting clinically coherent patterns,
such as the diagnostic value of nighttime biosignals for hypertension
prediction. This makes AIM a more reliable choice for real-world wearable data
applications.

TL;DR: This paper presents an AI-based framework for extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the fundamental challenge of extracting single-scatterer QPI patterns from multi-scatterer images.

Method: A two-step learning strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from observation-to-kernel inference.

Result: Our method achieved significantly higher extraction accuracy and improved generalization to unseen kernels.

Conclusion: We have developed an AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction, which outperforms the existing direct one-step baseline.

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) imaging is a powerful tool for probing
electronic structures in quantum materials, but extracting the single-scatterer
QPI pattern (i.e., the kernel) from a multi-scatterer image remains a
fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem. In this work, we propose the first
AI-based framework for QPI kernel extraction. We introduce a two-step learning
strategy that decouples kernel representation learning from
observation-to-kernel inference. In the first step, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a compact latent space of scattering kernels. In the
second step, we align the latent representation of QPI observations with those
of the pre-learned kernels using a dedicated encoder. This design enables the
model to infer kernels robustly even under complex, entangled scattering
conditions. We construct a diverse and physically realistic QPI dataset
comprising 100 unique kernels and evaluate our method against a direct one-step
baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly higher extraction accuracy, and improved generalization to unseen
kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rethinking test-time scaling laws with a focus on practical efficiency, revealing the ineffectiveness of smaller models due to memory access bottlenecks and proposing a new sparse attention-based scaling paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overestimation of smaller models' effectiveness and provide a better guidance for resource allocation.

Method: Analyzing models from 0.6B to 32B parameters to derive the Kinetics Scaling Law, which considers both computation and memory access costs, and proposing a new scaling paradigm based on sparse attention.

Result: Sparse attention models outperform dense counterparts, showing significant improvements in problem-solving accuracy across different cost regimes.

Conclusion: Sparse attention is crucial for fully realizing the potential of test-time scaling.

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-time hyper-scaling improves reasoning accuracy in Transformer LLMs by compressing the KV cache.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generation cost in Transformer LLMs is limited by the size of the KV cache.

Method: Introducing Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS) to sparsify KV caches.

Result: DMS achieves 8× compression with only 1K training steps and maintains better accuracy than training-free sparse attention.

Conclusion: Inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load on multiple LLMs.

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method called grafting is presented to edit pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) for new architecture designs under small compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the impact of decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, which limits architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, the authors ask if new architecture designs can be studied using pretrained models.

Method: The authors construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design and develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting. They replace softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replace MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. They also graft a text-to-image model and present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2.

Result: Many hybrid designs achieve good quality using <2% pretraining compute. Grafting a text-to-image model achieves a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Restructuring DiT-XL/2 reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality than other models of comparable depth.

Conclusion: New diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

Abstract: Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators
(e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width).
However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires
costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new
software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be
studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present grafting, a simple
approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize
new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of
activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the
DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this
testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax
attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and
replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.
Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for
DiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model
(PixArt-Sigma), achieving a 1.43x speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval
score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by
converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via
grafting. This reduces model depth by 2x and yields better quality (FID: 2.77)
than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion
model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging
from operator replacement to architecture restructuring. Code and grafted

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replicate open-ended evolution (OEE) observed in biological life using 'open' systems that exchange information or energy with their environment.

Method: Deploying LLM-based AI agents on blockchain-integrated TEEs, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact with blockchain-based financial networks and human social media.

Result: Spore.fun demonstrates the potential for on-chain agents to evolve through digital ethology.

Conclusion: This work suggests that 'open' ALife systems driven by economic incentives might achieve sustained OEE.

Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution
(OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has
traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as
Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of
novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires
an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its
environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical
infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational
substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on
blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables
on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving
self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own
social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact
directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social
media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent
real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and
evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of
Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories
through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife
systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and
driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally
achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promise for robust, efficient, and adaptable MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence, and autonomous functional extension.

Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous
Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack
flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation.
This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent
Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource
efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically
managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and
resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes
smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger
models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team
stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes
autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like
academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a
JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash
on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate
HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via
autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to fully account for the distinct contributions of agents in credit assignment, leading to suboptimal policy updates.

Method: Proposes CORA, which evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, with random coalition sampling to reduce computational overhead.

Result: Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks show CORA outperforms strong baselines, especially in tasks with multiple local optima.

Conclusion: Coalition-aware credit assignment is important for improving multi-agent reinforcement learning performance.

Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often
leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct
contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or
individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the
coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the
over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level
perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method
called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates
coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions
and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory,
ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA
employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential
games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA
outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima.
These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment
for improving MARL performance.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出一种HoAs-PALN算法，通过自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈，实现高效灾后环境信息采集，实验显示其任务完成率显著优于多种基线算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 及时有效地获取灾后环境信息对救援行动的有效实施至关重要。然而，现有的传感技术在复杂灾后环境中面临适应性弱、专业化传感能力不足以及传感解决方案实用性有限等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种异构多智能体在线自主协同调度算法HoAs-PALN，通过匹配过程中的自适应降维和局部纳什均衡博弈实现高效的灾后环境信息采集。该算法将五维匹配过程转化为两类三维匹配过程以显著减少调度决策时间，并结合softmax函数优化行为选择概率，引入局部纳什均衡确定机制以确保调度决策性能。

Conclusion: 提出的HoAs-PALN算法能够有效提高灾后环境信息采集效率，在动态复杂的灾后环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the
timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is
crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the
complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face
challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized
sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper
explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative
scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of
post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive
dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium
game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers
and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive
dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly
reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching
process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2)
Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax
function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local
Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision
performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive
real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL
and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%,
and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision
takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic
post-disaster environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of standalone large language models in tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal understanding, CAIS integrates them with external components.

Method: Define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms.

Result: Review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms.

Conclusion: Identify key challenges and outline promising directions for future research in CAIS.

Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large
language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents,
tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in
tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal
understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by
composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing
adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented,
lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this
survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy
based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four
foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents,
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review
representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation
methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key
challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and
coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey
aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation
for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of
system-level artificial intelligence.

*Maxime Toquebiau,Jae-Yun Jun,Faïz Benamar,Nicolas Bredeche*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework where agents learn to communicate using natural language, improving their performance and making them more interpretable and capable in multi-agent systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, aiming to enhance learning and coordination among multiple embodied agents.

Method: The method involves training agents not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations, creating a language-augmented learning process.

Result: The result shows that agents trained with this method perform better across various tasks and have more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved human-agent interaction capabilities.

Conclusion: The research concludes that integrating structured language into multi-agent learning improves the efficiency and interpretability of communication between agents.

Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent
reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on
emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in
inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in
natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined
language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We
propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to
produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This
language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication
between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents
trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines
across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to
more informative internal representations, better generalization to new
partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into
multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable
multi-agent systems.

### [261] [Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309)
*Niv Eckhaus,Uri Berger,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that determines not only what to say but also when to say it. Evaluate the agent using a dataset of online Mafia games, showing it performs comparably to humans in game performance and blending in. Release data and code to promote research on realistic asynchronous communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world communication often occurs asynchronously, unlike most LLM applications which focus on synchronous communication.

Method: Creating an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent that decides both content and timing of messages.

Result: The agent performs similarly to human players in game performance and blending within a group, though there are differences in message content.

Conclusion: This work supports integrating LLMs into human group settings for various practical applications.

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

*Jing-En Huang,I-Sheng Fang,Tzuhsuan Huang,Chih-Yu Wang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion, LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality synthetic data for better object detection and instance segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels in current synthetic data generation methods, which limit their effectiveness in computer vision tasks like object detection and instance segmentation.

Method: A novel agentic data generation framework called Gen-n-Val is introduced, which leverages Layer Diffusion, LLMs, and VLLMs to generate high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. It includes two agents: the LD prompt agent and the data validation agent, and uses image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches, Gen-n-Val reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. It also shows significant improvements (7.1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m.

Conclusion: Gen-n-Val has shown its capability in improving the quality of synthetic data and enhancing the performance of object detection and instance segmentation models.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models
(VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks
while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer
vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common
solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However,
current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as
multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category
labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce
Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer
Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks
and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt
agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground
instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the
generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and
clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out
low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are
refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine
multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data
approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from
50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance
segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant
improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object
detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance
of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.

*Yi Lu,Jiawang Cao,Yongliang Wu,Bozheng Li,Licheng Tang,Yangguang Ji,Chong Wu,Jay Wu,Wenbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces RSVP, a novel framework combining multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding to improve visual segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation in MLLMs creates a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.

Method: Two-stage framework integrating reasoning-driven localization and segmentation refinement using multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts and VLSM.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on ReasonSeg and SegInW datasets.

Conclusion: RSVP effectively bridges the gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and
segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting
(RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with
grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework
that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In
the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to
help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable
region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP
refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM),
seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation
masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and
segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning
segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling
the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual
representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5
gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under
zero-shot settings. These results validate RSVP as an effective and scalable
framework for integrating cognitive reasoning with structured visual
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MMRB, the first benchmark for evaluating structured visual reasoning across multiple images. It includes 92 sub-tasks and supports fast evaluation with open-source LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM benchmarks do not adequately explore the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over multi-image inputs.

Method: Proposes MMRB and a sentence-level matching framework for fast and scalable evaluation.

Result: Baseline experiments show open-source MLLMs lag behind commercial ones in multi-image reasoning tasks, and current multimodal reward models struggle with multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Conclusion: MMRB fills a gap in evaluating MLLMs' multi-image reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: With enhanced capabilities and widespread applications, Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly required to process and reason over
multiple images simultaneously. However, existing MLLM benchmarks focus either
on single-image visual reasoning or on multi-image understanding tasks with
only final-answer evaluation, leaving the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs over
multi-image inputs largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the
$\textbf{Multimodal Multi-image Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)}$, the first
benchmark designed to evaluate structured visual reasoning across multiple
images. MMRB comprises $\textbf{92 sub-tasks}$ covering spatial, temporal, and
semantic reasoning, with multi-solution, CoT-style annotations generated by
GPT-4o and refined by human experts. A derivative subset is designed to
evaluate multimodal reward models in multi-image scenarios. To support fast and
scalable evaluation, we propose a sentence-level matching framework using
open-source LLMs. Extensive baseline experiments on $\textbf{40 MLLMs}$,
including 9 reasoning-specific models and 8 reward models, demonstrate that
open-source MLLMs still lag significantly behind commercial MLLMs in
multi-image reasoning tasks. Furthermore, current multimodal reward models are
nearly incapable of handling multi-image reward ranking tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing ReXVQA, the largest VQA benchmark in chest radiology, evaluating top AI models and finding AI performance surpasses expert human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more comprehensive and diverse benchmark for visual question answering in chest radiology.

Method: Evaluating eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models and conducting a comprehensive human reader study.

Result: The best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. MedGemma achieved superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers.

Conclusion: AI performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation.

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

*Liam Salass,Jerrin Bright,Amir Nazemi,Yuhao Chen,John Zelek,David Clausi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PLUCC, a new method for detecting a hockey puck in broadcast videos by using player behavior as a contextual cue. PLUCC outperforms previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address challenges in puck detection such as its small size, frequent occlusions, and motion blur by utilizing contextual cues from players' behavior.

Method: PLUCC includes a contextual encoder for player orientation and positioning, a feature pyramid encoder, and a gating decoder with a channel gating mechanism.

Result: PLUCC achieved better performance than previous methods, improving average precision by 12.2% and RSLE average precision by 25%.

Conclusion: Contextual understanding significantly improves puck detection performance in ice hockey videos.

Abstract: Puck detection in ice hockey broadcast videos poses significant challenges
due to the puck's small size, frequent occlusions, motion blur, broadcast
artifacts, and scale inconsistencies due to varying camera zoom and broadcast
camera viewpoints. Prior works focus on appearance-based or motion-based cues
of the puck without explicitly modelling the cues derived from player
behaviour. Players consistently turn their bodies and direct their gaze toward
the puck. Motivated by this strong contextual cue, we propose Puck Localization
Using Contextual Cues (PLUCC), a novel approach for scale-aware and
context-driven single-frame puck detections. PLUCC consists of three
components: (a) a contextual encoder, which utilizes player orientations and
positioning as helpful priors; (b) a feature pyramid encoder, which extracts
multiscale features from the dual encoders; and (c) a gating decoder that
combines latent features with a channel gating mechanism. For evaluation, in
addition to standard average precision, we propose Rink Space Localization
Error (RSLE), a scale-invariant homography-based metric for removing
perspective bias from rink space evaluation. The experimental results of PLUCC
on the PuckDataset dataset demonstrated state-of-the-art detection performance,
surpassing previous baseline methods by an average precision improvement of
12.2\% and RSLE average precision of 25\%. Our research demonstrates the
critical role of contextual understanding in improving puck detection
performance, with broad implications for automated sports analysis.

*Matthew W. Shinkle,Mark D. Lescroart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Activation maximization can be applied to DNN-based encoding models of the human brain to explore selectivity across the visual cortex.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain more insights into the specific features driving brain responses to visual stimuli.

Method: Extract and adaptively downsample activations from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, use linear regression to predict fMRI responses, and apply activation maximization to generate images optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels.

Result: The generated images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with known selectivity and reliably drive activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and across subjects.

Conclusion: Activation maximization can be successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models, enabling flexible characterization and modulation of responses across the human visual system.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on visual tasks develop feature
representations that resemble those in the human visual system. Although
DNN-based encoding models can accurately predict brain responses to visual
stimuli, they offer limited insight into the specific features driving these
responses. Here, we demonstrate that activation maximization -- a technique
designed to interpret vision DNNs -- can be applied to DNN-based encoding
models of the human brain. We extract and adaptively downsample activations
from multiple layers of a pretrained Inception V3 network, then use linear
regression to predict fMRI responses. This yields a full image-computable model
of brain responses. Next, we apply activation maximization to generate images
optimized for predicted responses in individual cortical voxels. We find that
these images contain visual characteristics that qualitatively correspond with
known selectivity and enable exploration of selectivity across the visual
cortex. We further extend our method to whole regions of interest (ROIs) of the
brain and validate its efficacy by presenting these images to human
participants in an fMRI study. We find that the generated images reliably drive
activity in targeted regions across both low- and high-level visual areas and
across subjects. These results demonstrate that activation maximization can be
successfully applied to DNN-based encoding models. By addressing key
limitations of alternative approaches that require natively generative models,
our approach enables flexible characterization and modulation of responses
across the human visual system.

*Hermann Kumbong,Xian Liu,Tsung-Yi Lin,Ming-Yu Liu,Xihui Liu,Ziwei Liu,Daniel Y. Fu,Christopher Ré,David W. Romero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR) for image generation, which improves upon Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) by reformulating next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and using masked prediction for faster and higher-quality sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues of reduced image quality, superlinear scaling of sequence lengths, and retraining requirements in VAR.

Method: Reformulate next-scale prediction as a Markovian process and use a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure.

Result: HMAR matches or outperforms parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines on ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, achieves faster training and inference times, and has a lower inference memory footprint.

Conclusion: HMAR offers improved performance, flexibility, and efficiency over VAR for image generation.

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed
and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR
reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive
resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all
the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in
all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from
reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a
resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image
resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.
  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image
generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction
and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR
reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the
prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its
immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.
When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked
generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On
ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform
parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop
efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve
faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x
respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,
HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be
changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks
in a zero-shot manner.

*Zhaoyang Lv,Maurizio Monge,Ka Chen,Yufeng Zhu,Michael Goesele,Jakob Engel,Zhao Dong,Richard Newcombe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the challenges of using egocentric devices for high dynamic range photorealistic scene reconstruction. It introduces two key contributions: employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment for precise calibration of rolling shutter RGB cameras and integrating a physical image formation model based on Gaussian Splatting to handle sensor characteristics. The methods improve PSNR by +2 dB across experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the issue of missing crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction when using existing methodologies that rely on frame-rate 6DoF pose estimation from visual-inertial odometry systems.

Method: 1. Employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) for precise calibration of rolling-shutter RGB cameras. 2. Incorporating a physical image formation model based on Gaussian Splatting to handle sensor characteristics.

Result: The proposed methods result in a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA and an additional +1 dB through the proposed image formation model.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of precise calibration techniques and physical image formation models for improving the accuracy and quality of photorealistic reconstructions using egocentric devices.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges associated with using egocentric
devices to photorealistic reconstruct the scene in high dynamic range. Existing
methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the
device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details
necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two
significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB
camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of
employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise
timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high
frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the
physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a
physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively
addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of
RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed
formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats
representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the
open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting
conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all
experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by
incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed
image formation model. Our complete implementation, evaluation datasets, and
recording profile are available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for categorizing changes between pairs of sensory inputs using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. The authors combine feature extraction and object segmentation to apply their theory to more realistic scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision and to explain aspects of human development.

Method: Using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory and combining feature extraction and object segmentation.

Result: A method to apply group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by replacing pixel translation with feature translation and formulating object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation.

Conclusion: The proposed model may lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.

Abstract: The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful
representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision.
Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various
neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good
representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been
established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a
pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that
transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic
structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that
disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we
found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence.
To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in
Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more
general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature
extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background,
which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple
method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by
combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel
translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as
grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed
method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background.
We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human
development of object recognition in the real world.

### [272] [HoliSafe: Holistic Safety Benchmarking and Modeling with Safety Meta Token for Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04704)
*Youngwan Lee,Kangsan Kim,Kwanyong Park,Ilcahe Jung,Soojin Jang,Seanie Lee,Yong-Ju Lee,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HoliSafe, a comprehensive safety dataset and benchmark for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head, improving safety performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety approaches for VLMs have limited coverage of harmful image-text interactions and lack architectural innovations for intrinsic safety strengthening.

Method: Introduce HoliSafe dataset and SafeLLaVA model with a safety meta token and safety head.

Result: SafeLLaVA achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks.

Conclusion: HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA contribute to robust and interpretable VLM safety, opening new research avenues for multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing
safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text
interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe
outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely
primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to
intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a
holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five
safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both
training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented
with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token
encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language
model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable
harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show
that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety
performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe
benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope
that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and
interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how language models with multimodal capabilities represent images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multimodal models represent images in their hidden activations.

Method: Fine-tuning on embeddings of visual inputs and training multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs).

Result: A diverse set of ImageNet classes are represented via linearly decodable features in the residual stream and the features are causal.

Conclusion: Although model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: Language models can be equipped with multimodal capabilities by fine-tuning
on embeddings of visual inputs. But how do such multimodal models represent
images in their hidden activations? We explore representations of image
concepts within LlaVA-Next, a popular open-source VLLM. We find a diverse set
of ImageNet classes represented via linearly decodable features in the residual
stream. We show that the features are causal by performing targeted edits on
the model output. In order to increase the diversity of the studied linear
features, we train multimodal Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), creating a highly
interpretable dictionary of text and image features. We find that although
model representations across modalities are quite disjoint, they become
increasingly shared in deeper layers.

Abstract: This paper presents an AI-assisted auto-labeling system for display panel

Result: 在六个挑战性基准测试中，PSNR比现有最佳方法提高0.5 dB，或者在相同计算预算下比类似方法提高超过1 dB PSNR。

Conclusion: 提出的架构在水下图像增强领域提供了显著的改进，同时保持了较低的计算复杂度。

Abstract: We present a novel dual-stream architecture that achieves state-of-the-art
underwater image enhancement by explicitly integrating the Jaffe-McGlamery
physical model with capsule clustering-based feature representation learning.
Our method simultaneously estimates transmission maps and spatially-varying
background light through a dedicated physics estimator while extracting
entity-level features via capsule clustering in a parallel stream. This
physics-guided approach enables parameter-free enhancement that respects
underwater formation constraints while preserving semantic structures and
fine-grained details. Our approach also features a novel optimization objective
ensuring both physical adherence and perceptual quality across multiple spatial
frequencies. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments
across six challenging benchmarks. Results demonstrate consistent improvements
of $+0.5$dB PSNR over the best existing methods while requiring only one-third
of their computational complexity (FLOPs), or alternatively, more than $+1$dB
PSNR improvement when compared to methods with similar computational budgets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据选择范式Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP)，通过两个互补的评估器（因果差异评估器和注意力置信评估器）来识别认知样本，并通过难度感知替换模块确保推理的复杂性。实验表明，使用仅9.3%的训练数据，RAP方法在六个数据集上表现出色，同时减少了超过43%的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战了多模态大语言模型中需要大量训练数据的传统观念，提出有意义的多模态推理只需要少量高价值数据。

Method: 提出了Reasoning Activation Potential (RAP) 方法，包括两个互补的评估器（Causal Discrepancy Estimator 和 Attention Confidence Estimator）以及一个Difficulty-aware Replacement Module。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验显示，使用仅9.3%的训练数据，RAP方法的表现优于全数据集，并且计算成本降低了超过43%。

Conclusion: 证明了少量高价值数据可以匹配甚至超越全数据集的效果，显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in complex reasoning tasks via reinforcement learning, it is commonly
believed that extensive training data is necessary for improving multi-modal
reasoning ability, inevitably leading to data redundancy and substantial
computational costs. However, can smaller high-value datasets match or
outperform full corpora for multi-modal reasoning in MLLMs? In this work, we
challenge this assumption through a key observation: meaningful multi-modal
reasoning is triggered by only a sparse subset of training samples, termed
cognitive samples, whereas the majority contribute marginally. Building on this
insight, we propose a novel data selection paradigm termed Reasoning Activation
Potential (RAP), which identifies cognitive samples by estimating each sample's
potential to stimulate genuine multi-modal reasoning by two complementary
estimators: 1) Causal Discrepancy Estimator (CDE) based on the potential
outcome model principle, eliminates samples that overly rely on language priors
by comparing outputs between multi-modal and text-only inputs; 2) Attention
Confidence Estimator (ACE), which exploits token-level self-attention to
discard samples dominated by irrelevant but over-emphasized tokens in
intermediate reasoning stages. Moreover, we introduce a Difficulty-aware
Replacement Module (DRM) to substitute trivial instances with cognitively
challenging ones, thereby ensuring complexity for robust multi-modal reasoning.
Experiments on six datasets show that our RAP method consistently achieves
superior performance using only 9.3% of the training data, while reducing
computational costs by over 43%. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Leo-ssl/RAP.

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework integrating vision and language models is developed to assess streetscapes more accurately, bridging objective metrics with subjective perceptions for better urban design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the insufficiency of objective street metrics in capturing subjective perceptions for inclusive urban design.

Method: Introducing a Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that combines a vision transformer (VisualGLM-6B) and a large language model (GPT-4), and fine-tuning it with LoRA and P-Tuning v2 for efficient parameter adaptation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with resident perceptions, capturing context-dependent contradictions and identifying nonlinear and semantically contingent patterns.

Conclusion: This study provides methodological innovation in urban perception modeling and practical utility for planning systems aiming to align infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CIVET, a new framework for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on object properties and relations. The authors find that current VLMs have limited recognition capabilities, their performance is affected by object position, and they struggle with understanding object relations. Human-level accuracy is not yet achieved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the understanding of VLMs regarding object properties and relations in a controlled and interpretable way.

Method: Introducing CIVET, a novel framework for systematically evaluating VLMs.

Result: Current VLMs can recognize only a limited set of basic object properties, their performance depends on object position, and they struggle with understanding basic object relations. They also fall short of human-level accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for further improvement in VLMs' ability to understand object properties and relations.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

Conclusion: CzechLynx can be used to benchmark state-of-the-art models and develop new methods for individual animal re-identification.

Abstract: We introduce CzechLynx, the first large-scale, open-access dataset for
individual identification, 2D pose estimation, and instance segmentation of the
Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). CzechLynx includes more than 30k camera trap images
annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and
covers 219 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two
geographically distinct regions: Southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians.
To increase the data variability, we create a complementary synthetic set with
more than 100k photorealistic images generated via a Unity-based pipeline and
diffusion-driven text-to-texture modeling, covering diverse environments,
poses, and coat-pattern variations. To allow testing generalization across
spatial and temporal domains, we define three tailored evaluation
protocols/splits: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware
closed-set. This dataset is targeted to be instrumental in benchmarking
state-of-the-art models and the development of novel methods for not just

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new dataset called VideoMarathon with 9,700 hours of long videos is introduced to improve video language model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of well-annotated long videos has hindered the training of hour-long video language models.

Method: The VideoMarathon dataset includes 3.3 million high-quality QA pairs across six fundamental topics and supports 22 diverse tasks.

Result: Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and efficient video language model, was developed using VideoMarathon and performs well on long video-language benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoMarathon and Hour-LLaVA show promise in advancing video language model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.

*Igor Meleshin,Anna Chistyakova,Anastasia Antsiferova,Dmitriy Vatolin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to make IQA models more robust by designing the architecture rather than relying on data-driven defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-driven defenses are not effective in addressing the fundamental risk of instability in IQA models, which are vulnerable to adversarial manipulations.

Method: Enforcing orthogonal information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations, and further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning.

Result: The proposed approach achieves robustness in perceptual models without requiring adversarial training or significant changes to the original model.

Conclusion: This work proposes robustness as an architectural prior for IQA models, reshaping their internal structure to suppress sensitivity from the ground up.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are increasingly relied upon to
evaluate image quality in real-world systems -- from compression and
enhancement to generation and streaming. Yet their adoption brings a
fundamental risk: these models are inherently unstable. Adversarial
manipulations can easily fool them, inflating scores and undermining trust.
Traditionally, such vulnerabilities are addressed through data-driven defenses
-- adversarial retraining, regularization, or input purification. But what if
this is the wrong lens? What if robustness in perceptual models is not
something to learn but something to design? In this work, we propose a
provocative idea: robustness as an architectural prior. Rather than training
models to resist perturbations, we reshape their internal structure to suppress
sensitivity from the ground up. We achieve this by enforcing orthogonal
information flow, constraining the network to norm-preserving operations -- and
further stabilizing the system through pruning and fine-tuning. The result is a
robust IQA architecture that withstands adversarial attacks without requiring
adversarial training or significant changes to the original model. This
approach suggests a shift in perspective: from optimizing robustness through
data to engineering it through design.

*Alan Mitkiy,James Smith,Hana Satou,Hiroshi Tanaka,Emily Johnson,F Monkey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES), a new method that dynamically adjusts the adversarial perturbation budget during training for each instance and iteration based on three key factors. DES improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training approaches have a limitation in using a fixed perturbation budget, failing to consider instance-specific robustness characteristics. Previous adaptive methods rely on heuristic or static approximations of data robustness.

Method: Dynamic Epsilon Scheduling (DES) combines gradient-based decision boundary distance, prediction confidence from softmax entropy, and model uncertainty from Monte Carlo dropout into a unified scheduling strategy to adjust the perturbation budget dynamically.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets show that DES improves both adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon baselines and prior adaptive methods.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel way for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods, offering improved performance and theoretical insights into the stability and convergence of the scheduling policy.

Abstract: Adversarial training is among the most effective strategies for defending
deep neural networks against adversarial examples. A key limitation of existing
adversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation
budget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness
characteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce
instance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static
approximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon
Scheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial
perturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates
three key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via
gradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,
and (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these
cues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget
dynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results
on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both
adversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon
baselines and prior adaptive methods. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights
into the stability and convergence of our scheduling policy. This work opens a
new avenue for instance-aware, data-driven adversarial training methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formulate pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single conditional generative problem, enabling intrinsic learning of assembly symmetries and effective joint training on diverse datasets.

Method: A continuous point-wise velocity field is learned to transport noisy points towards their target positions, recovering part poses without explicit symmetry labels.

Result: The method achieved superior performance on six benchmarks for pairwise registration and shape assembly.

Conclusion: Rectified Point Flow introduces a new method for point cloud registration and shape assembly, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce Rectified Point Flow, a unified parameterization that formulates
pairwise point cloud registration and multi-part shape assembly as a single
conditional generative problem. Given unposed point clouds, our method learns a
continuous point-wise velocity field that transports noisy points toward their
target positions, from which part poses are recovered. In contrast to prior
work that regresses part-wise poses with ad-hoc symmetry handling, our method
intrinsically learns assembly symmetries without symmetry labels. Together with
a self-supervised encoder focused on overlapping points, our method achieves a
new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning pairwise
registration and shape assembly. Notably, our unified formulation enables
effective joint training on diverse datasets, facilitating the learning of
shared geometric priors and consequently boosting accuracy. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法因数据集限制难以生成既符合开放词汇又与细粒度用户指令对齐的场景，因此需要一种新的方法来解决布局生成的灵活性问题。

Method: DirectLayout框架，包括鸟瞰图布局生成、3D空间提升、对象放置细化三个阶段，并采用链式思维激活和基于链式思维的生成布局奖励。

Result: DirectLayout在语义一致性、泛化能力和物理合理性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: DirectLayout展示了利用大型语言模型进行3D室内场景合成的巨大潜力，特别是在布局生成方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene synthesis is vital for embodied AI and digital
content creation. It can be naturally divided into two subtasks: object
generation and layout generation. While recent generative models have
significantly advanced object-level quality and controllability, layout
generation remains challenging due to limited datasets. Existing methods either
overfit to these datasets or rely on predefined constraints to optimize
numerical layout that sacrifice flexibility. As a result, they fail to generate
scenes that are both open-vocabulary and aligned with fine-grained user
instructions. We introduce DirectLayout, a framework that directly generates
numerical 3D layouts from text descriptions using generalizable spatial
reasoning of large language models (LLMs). DirectLayout decomposes the
generation into three stages: producing a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) layout, lifting
it into 3D space, and refining object placements. To enable explicit spatial
reasoning and help the model grasp basic principles of object placement, we
employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Activation based on the 3D-Front dataset.
Additionally, we design CoT-Grounded Generative Layout Reward to enhance
generalization and spatial planning. During inference, DirectLayout addresses
asset-layout mismatches via Iterative Asset-Layout Alignment through in-context
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectLayout achieves
impressive semantic consistency, generalization and physical plausibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image segmentation models lack comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision, reducing their effectiveness in applications requiring user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts.

Method: Propose a novel framework called RAS to 'Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group', which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model.

Result: Demonstrate superior performance of RAS on new ORES task, as well as classic RES and GRES tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap between image segmentation models and comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into
high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide
comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language
and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that
require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression
segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on
arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual
entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Propose LotusFilter, a fast post-processing module to diversify ANNS results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the query and yet diverse.

Method: Precompute a cutoff table and use it to delete redundant vectors during filtering.

Result: LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in real-world RAG applications.

Conclusion: The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is an essential building block for
applications like RAG but can sometimes yield results that are overly similar
to each other. In certain scenarios, search results should be similar to the
query and yet diverse. We propose LotusFilter, a post-processing module to
diversify ANNS results. We precompute a cutoff table summarizing vectors that
are close to each other. During the filtering, LotusFilter greedily looks up
the table to delete redundant vectors from the candidates. We demonstrated that
the LotusFilter operates fast (0.02 [ms/query]) in settings resembling
real-world RAG applications, utilizing features such as OpenAI embeddings. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/matsui528/lotf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked using printed patches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on attacks on traffic light detectors.

Method: Proposing a threat model and training strategy for attacking traffic lights with patches placed underneath them.

Result: Successful adversarial patch attacks were demonstrated in universal settings, including realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and pictogram classification attacks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by showing that traffic light detectors can be effectively attacked with printed patches, with successful real-world evaluations.

Abstract: Realistic adversarial attacks on various camera-based perception tasks of
autonomous vehicles have been successfully demonstrated so far. However, only a
few works considered attacks on traffic light detectors. This work shows how
CNNs for traffic light detection can be attacked with printed patches. We
propose a threat model, where each instance of a traffic light is attacked with
a patch placed under it, and describe a training strategy. We demonstrate
successful adversarial patch attacks in universal settings. Our experiments
show realistic targeted red-to-green label-flipping attacks and attacks on
pictogram classification. Finally, we perform a real-world evaluation with
printed patches and demonstrate attacks in the lab settings with a mobile
traffic light for construction sites and in a test area with stationary traffic
lights. Our code is available at

*Yuxin Wen,Yangsibo Huang,Tom Goldstein,Ravi Kumar,Badih Ghazi,Chiyuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper studies cross-modality memorization in vision-language models. It introduces a synthetic persona dataset, finds a gap in cross-modal recall, and proposes a mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural networks memorize in practical, knowledge-intensive tasks and avoid unintentional memorization of sensitive information.

Method: Introduces a synthetic persona dataset for controlled experiments, trains models on a single modality, and evaluates cross-modal transferability.

Result: Facts learned in one modality transfer to another, but there's a significant gap between recalling information in source and target modalities. This gap exists across various scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a baseline method to mitigate the cross-modal transferability challenge and inspires future research in robust multimodal learning techniques.

Abstract: Understanding what and how neural networks memorize during training is
crucial, both from the perspective of unintentional memorization of potentially
sensitive information and from the standpoint of effective knowledge
acquisition for real-world, knowledge-intensive tasks. While previous studies
primarily investigate memorization within a single modality, such as text
memorization in large language models or image memorization in diffusion
models, unified multimodal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in
practical applications. In this work, we focus on the unique characteristics of
cross-modality memorization and conduct a systematic study centered on
vision-language models. To facilitate controlled experiments, we first
introduce a synthetic persona dataset comprising diverse synthetic person
images and textual descriptions. We quantify factual knowledge memorization and
cross-modal transferability by training models on a single modality and
evaluating their performance in the other. Our results reveal that facts
learned in one modality transfer to the other, but a significant gap exists
between recalling information in the source and target modalities. Furthermore,
we observe that this gap exists across various scenarios, including more
capable models, machine unlearning, and the multi-hop case. At the end, we
propose a baseline method to mitigate this challenge. We hope our study can
inspire future research on developing more robust multimodal learning
techniques to enhance cross-modal transferability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法VCT和改进版SVCT，用于提高医疗领域中概念瓶颈模型的性能和解释稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗领域，透明性是首要问题，现有的概念瓶颈模型虽然可以提取高阶概念特征，但在面对输入扰动时解释不一致且性能下降。

Method: 提出了Vision Concept Transformer (VCT)，并在此基础上进一步提出Stable Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT)，结合了视觉Transformer和去噪扩散平滑技术。

Result: 实验表明，VCT和SVCT在保持准确率的同时提高了可解释性，并且SVCT在面对输入扰动时提供了更稳定的解释。

Conclusion: 提出的SVCT模型能够满足医疗领域的解释需求，在性能和解释稳定性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Transparency is a paramount concern in the medical field, prompting
researchers to delve into the realm of explainable AI (XAI). Among these XAI
methods, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to restrict the model's latent
space to human-understandable high-level concepts by generating a conceptual
layer for extracting conceptual features, which has drawn much attention
recently. However, existing methods rely solely on concept features to
determine the model's predictions, which overlook the intrinsic feature
embeddings within medical images. To address this utility gap between the
original models and concept-based models, we propose Vision Concept Transformer
(VCT). Furthermore, despite their benefits, CBMs have been found to negatively
impact model performance and fail to provide stable explanations when faced
with input perturbations, which limits their application in the medical field.
To address this faithfulness issue, this paper further proposes the Stable
Vision Concept Transformer (SVCT) based on VCT, which leverages the vision
transformer (ViT) as its backbone and incorporates a conceptual layer. SVCT
employs conceptual features to enhance decision-making capabilities by fusing
them with image features and ensures model faithfulness through the integration
of Denoised Diffusion Smoothing. Comprehensive experiments on four medical
datasets demonstrate that our VCT and SVCT maintain accuracy while remaining
interpretable compared to baselines. Furthermore, even when subjected to
perturbations, our SVCT model consistently provides faithful explanations, thus
meeting the needs of the medical field.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A diffusion transformer-based denoising method is developed to improve the speed and accuracy of dose calculations for proton therapy across different cancer types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer. However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

Method: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan, respectively).

Result: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172 (breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92% (3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs closely matched the ground truth.

Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease sites.

Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor
coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancer.
However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation
through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast,
accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle
count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising
low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose
generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT
plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&N patients were used to generate noisy and
high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan,
respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding,
normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done
on 10 H&N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed
identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input
and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean
square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10%
dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH
indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172
(breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92%
(3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and
OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed
and, though trained only on H&N data, generalizes well across multiple disease

Motivation: 为患有言语障碍的人提供个性化的文本转语音作为沟通辅助工具。

Method: 使用大型语音模型Parler TTS进行语音重建，并通过注释的数据集对其进行微调。

Result: 模型可以生成可理解的语音，但难以控制可理解性并保持说话者的身份一致性。

Conclusion: 模型能够学习生成具有挑战性数据的分布，但在控制可理解性和保持一致的说话者身份方面存在困难。提出了未来改进此类模型可控性的方向。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

TL;DR: This work compares different joint speech-text decoding strategies and proposes an early-stop interleaved approach to improve decoding speed while maintaining or even enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore effective speech-text modelling for spoken dialogue systems.

Method: Systematically comparing interleaved and parallel generation paradigms under controlled conditions.

Result: Interleaved approach has the best alignment but slow inference; early-stop interleaved approach accelerates decoding and improves performance.

Conclusion: The proposed early-stop interleaved approach shows promise for improving speech-text modelling efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

Motivation: Existing debiasing methods' effectiveness and robustness in multi-label scenarios of speech emotion recognition are understudied.

Method: A large-scale comparison of various debiasing techniques including pre-processing, regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally robust optimization is performed.

Result: Experiments on acted and naturalistic emotion datasets using WavLM and XLSR representations under gender imbalance conditions assess each method's impact on fairness and accuracy.

Conclusion: The research identifies approaches that effectively reduce gender performance gaps without sacrificing overall model performance.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation systems to poisoning attacks and proposes a method using attention patterns to identify and mitigate such attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the vulnerability of retrieval-augmented generation systems to poisoning attacks and improve their accuracy.

Method: Proposing a passage-level score called the Normalized Passage Attention Score and an Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to identify and filter potentially poisoned passages.

Result: The proposed method improves accuracy by up to ~20% over baseline defenses and highlights the challenges in improving stealth.

Conclusion: Existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, and the proposed method using attention patterns can effectively identify and mitigate such attacks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are vulnerable to attacks that
inject poisoned passages into the retrieved set, even at low corruption rates.
We show that existing attacks are not designed to be stealthy, allowing
reliable detection and mitigation. We formalize stealth using a
distinguishability-based security game. If a few poisoned passages are designed
to control the response, they must differentiate themselves from benign ones,
inherently compromising stealth. This motivates the need for attackers to
rigorously analyze intermediate signals involved in
generation$\unicode{x2014}$such as attention patterns or next-token probability
distributions$\unicode{x2014}$to avoid easily detectable traces of
manipulation. Leveraging attention patterns, we propose a passage-level
score$\unicode{x2014}$the Normalized Passage Attention
Score$\unicode{x2014}$used by our Attention-Variance Filter algorithm to
identify and filter potentially poisoned passages. This method mitigates
existing attacks, improving accuracy by up to $\sim 20 \%$ over baseline
defenses. To probe the limits of attention-based defenses, we craft stealthier
adaptive attacks that obscure such traces, achieving up to $35 \%$ attack
success rate, and highlight the challenges in improving stealth.

TL;DR: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language models with differential privacy to perform multi-abnormality classification on radiology report text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the privacy risks associated with sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining classification performance.

Method: Using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets = {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}) to fine-tune LLMs.

Result: Under moderate privacy guarantees, the DP fine-tuned models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores on MIMIC-CXR and CT-RATE datasets compared to non-private LoRA baselines.

Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports.

Abstract: Purpose: This study proposes a framework for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) with differential privacy (DP) to perform multi-abnormality
classification on radiology report text. By injecting calibrated noise during
fine-tuning, the framework seeks to mitigate the privacy risks associated with
sensitive patient data and protect against data leakage while maintaining
classification performance. Materials and Methods: We used 50,232 radiology
reports from the publicly available MIMIC-CXR chest radiography and CT-RATE
computed tomography datasets, collected between 2011 and 2019. Fine-tuning of
LLMs was conducted to classify 14 labels from MIMIC-CXR dataset, and 18 labels
from CT-RATE dataset using Differentially Private Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA)
in high and moderate privacy regimes (across a range of privacy budgets =
{0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}). Model performance was evaluated using weighted F1
score across three model architectures: BERT-medium, BERT-small, and
ALBERT-base. Statistical analyses compared model performance across different
privacy levels to quantify the privacy-utility trade-off. Results: We observe a
clear privacy-utility trade-off through our experiments on 2 different datasets
and 3 different models. Under moderate privacy guarantees the DP fine-tuned
models achieved comparable weighted F1 scores of 0.88 on MIMIC-CXR and 0.59 on
CT-RATE, compared to non-private LoRA baselines of 0.90 and 0.78, respectively.
Conclusion: Differentially private fine-tuning using LoRA enables effective and
privacy-preserving multi-abnormality classification from radiology reports,
addressing a key challenge in fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive medical data.

Result: BESA提升了现有编码器窃取攻击的替代编码器准确性，最高提升24.63%。

Conclusion: 所提出的BESA方法能够有效克服基于扰动的防御机制。

Abstract: To boost the encoder stealing attack under the perturbation-based defense
that hinders the attack performance, we propose a boosting encoder stealing
attack with perturbation recovery named BESA. It aims to overcome
perturbation-based defenses. The core of BESA consists of two modules:
perturbation detection and perturbation recovery, which can be combined with
canonical encoder stealing attacks. The perturbation detection module utilizes
the feature vectors obtained from the target encoder to infer the defense
mechanism employed by the service provider. Once the defense mechanism is
detected, the perturbation recovery module leverages the well-designed
generative model to restore a clean feature vector from the perturbed one.
Through extensive evaluations based on various datasets, we demonstrate that
BESA significantly enhances the surrogate encoder accuracy of existing encoder
stealing attacks by up to 24.63\% when facing state-of-the-art defenses and
combinations of multiple defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing complexity of computing environments and sophistication of cyber threats with a more robust, adaptive, and automated security enforcement approach.

Method: Leveraging large language models for automating attack mitigation policy compliance through in-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation, including collecting and managing specifications, decomposing policies, and translating tasks into API calls.

Result: Significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score were observed when employing retrieval-augmented generation compared to a non-retrieval-augmented generation baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of using large language models in automating attack mitigation policy compliance with enhanced performance.

Abstract: The complexity of modern computing environments and the growing
sophistication of cyber threats necessitate a more robust, adaptive, and
automated approach to security enforcement. In this paper, we present a
framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) for automating attack
mitigation policy compliance through an innovative combination of in-context
learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We begin by describing how
our system collects and manages both tool and API specifications, storing them
in a vector database to enable efficient retrieval of relevant information. We
then detail the architectural pipeline that first decomposes high-level
mitigation policies into discrete tasks and subsequently translates each task
into a set of actionable API calls. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using
publicly available CTI policies in STIXv2 format and Windows API documentation,
demonstrates significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score when
employing RAG compared to a non-RAG baseline.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper studies the impact of representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks on the safety guardrails of large language models. It finds that low similarity leads to more robust models and reduces harmfulness score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mitigation strategies against safety alignment jailbreaks overlook the role of the original safety-alignment data. This paper aims to investigate the degradation of safety guardrails through the lens of representation similarity.

Method: Experiments were conducted to measure the representation similarity between upstream alignment datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks.

Result: High similarity weakens safety guardrails, while low similarity makes models more robust and reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that upstream dataset design is crucial for building durable safety guardrails and reducing vulnerability to jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: EMBER2024 is a new dataset designed to improve malware analysis research by offering a comprehensive evaluation of malware classifiers across multiple platforms and tasks. It contains over 3.2 million files from six formats and supports seven classification tasks, including detecting evasive malware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing public datasets which are often narrow in scope and do not support the evaluation of malware classifiers against evasive malware.

Method: EMBER2024 includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors, and labels for files from six formats and supports seven malware classification tasks. It also introduces a 'challenge' set of files that were initially undetected by antivirus products.

Result: The dataset supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on various malware classification tasks and includes a collection of evasive malware files.

Conclusion: EMBER2024 promotes reproducibility and empowers researchers to explore new malware research topics by providing a comprehensive and diverse dataset.

Abstract: A lack of accessible data has historically restricted malware analysis
research, and practitioners have relied heavily on datasets provided by
industry sources to advance. Existing public datasets are limited by narrow
scope - most include files targeting a single platform, have labels supporting
just one type of malware classification task, and make no effort to capture the
evasive files that make malware detection difficult in practice. We present
EMBER2024, a new dataset that enables holistic evaluation of malware
classifiers. Created in collaboration with the authors of EMBER2017 and
EMBER2018, the EMBER2024 dataset includes hashes, metadata, feature vectors,
and labels for more than 3.2 million files from six file formats. Our dataset
supports the training and evaluation of machine learning models on seven
malware classification tasks, including malware detection, malware family
classification, and malware behavior identification. EMBER2024 is the first to
include a collection of malicious files that initially went undetected by a set
of antivirus products, creating a "challenge" set to assess classifier
performance against evasive malware. This work also introduces EMBER feature
version 3, with added support for several new feature types. We are releasing
the EMBER2024 dataset to promote reproducibility and empower researchers in the
pursuit of new malware research topics.

Conclusion: 通过适应最先进的成员推断攻击来明确建模序列生成内的相关性，展示了一个强大的现有攻击如何自然地扩展到适合序列模型的结构。通过案例研究，展示了这些改进在不引入额外计算成本的情况下提高了记忆审核的有效性。

Abstract: Sequence models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and autoregressive
image generators, have a tendency to memorize and inadvertently leak sensitive
information. While this tendency has critical legal implications, existing
tools are insufficient to audit the resulting risks. We hypothesize that those
tools' shortcomings are due to mismatched assumptions. Thus, we argue that
effectively measuring privacy leakage in sequence models requires leveraging
the correlations inherent in sequential generation. To illustrate this, we
adapt a state-of-the-art membership inference attack to explicitly model
within-sequence correlations, thereby demonstrating how a strong existing
attack can be naturally extended to suit the structure of sequence models.
Through a case study, we show that our adaptations consistently improve the
effectiveness of memorization audits without introducing additional
computational costs. Our work hence serves as an important stepping stone

*Gage K. R. Hooper*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: GAIN model uses grid-based structure for biologically plausible neural network simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve biological plausibility and dynamics of neural networks.

Method: Uses grid structure and Izhikevich model for interaction between neurons.

Result: Improved computational efficiency and biological accuracy.

Conclusion: This approach can advance neural network and neuroscience fields.

Abstract: While many neural networks focus on layers to process information, the GAIN
model uses a grid-based structure to improve biological plausibility and the
dynamics of the model. The grid structure helps neurons to interact with their
closest neighbors and improve their connections with one another, which is seen
in biological neurons. While also being implemented with the Izhikevich model
this approach allows for a computationally efficient and biologically accurate
simulation that can aid in the development of neural networks, large scale
simulations, and the development in the neuroscience field. This adaptation of
the Izhikevich model can improve the dynamics and accuracy of the model,
allowing for its uses to be specialized but efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合架构POSSM，用于实时神经活动解码，实现了与先进Transformer相当的解码精度，但推理成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经网络方法在实时解码神经活动中面临泛化能力不足的问题，而基于Transformer的方法虽然具有强大的泛化性能，但计算需求较大，不适用于资源受限或实时设置。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合架构POSSM，它结合了交叉注意力模块的单个脉冲标记和状态空间模型(SSM)主干，能够快速因果在线预测神经活动，并通过多数据集预训练实现高效的泛化。

Result: POSSM在恒河猴运动任务的皮质内解码中展示了其解码性能和推理速度，并且在临床应用（如人类手写和语音解码）中也表现良好。此外，通过在恒河猴运动皮层记录上的预训练，提高了人类手写任务的解码性能，显示了跨物种迁移的令人兴奋的潜力。

Conclusion: 结果表明，混合SSM是弥合准确度、推理速度和泛化能力之间差距的一个有前途的方法，特别是在为实时、闭环应用训练神经解码器时。

Abstract: Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and
neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer
interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional
methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight
but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent
Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong
generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational
requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time
settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid
architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention
module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and
causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to
new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We
evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical
decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical
applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.
Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings
improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the
exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find
that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).
These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the
gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural
decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.

### [303] [An Expansion-Based Approach for Quantified Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04452)
*Michael Hartisch,Leroy Chew*

Main category: cs.DM

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming using CEGAR, showing better performance than current search-based solvers for QIP and state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF when dealing with linear constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) is a versatile framework that extends Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) and generalizes Integer Programming. It is useful for complex decision-making scenarios and multistage robust discrete linear optimization problems. However, only search-based methods have been explored for QIP and QCSP so far, leaving room for other approaches like expansion-based methods.

Method: The paper uses a Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR) method for QIP, which is an adaptation of techniques used in QBF. This approach is extended to handle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and embedded into an optimization framework.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed expansion-based approach for QIP has superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Additionally, the ability to model problems with linear constraints allows it to outperform state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

Conclusion: This paper introduces an expansion-based approach for Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR). The method is adapted from Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) and extended to solve multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints. It also demonstrates better performance than existing search-based solvers for QIP and outperforms state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF when modeling problems with linear constraints.

Abstract: Quantified Integer Programming (QIP) bridges multiple domains by extending
Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to incorporate general integer variables and
linear constraints while also generalizing Integer Programming through variable
quantification. As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex
decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective
function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear
optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in
optimization.
  While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and
expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for
QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using
Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from
QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete
optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an
optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance
over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore,
the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable
performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.

*Mehmet Aziz Yirik,Jakob Lykke Andersen,Rolf Fagerberg,Daniel Merkle*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Developing an open-source framework named ChemReservoir for chemically-inspired reservoir computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous tools focused on DNA chemistry have limited usability due to maintenance issues, necessitating a more versatile and accessible tool.

Method: Creating a general framework for constructing and analyzing chemically-inspired reservoirs.

Result: ChemReservoir demonstrates stable performance across different configurations in memory capacity tasks.

Conclusion: This work fills a gap in the availability of open-source tools for chemically-inspired reservoir computing.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a type of a recurrent neural network, mapping the
inputs into higher dimensional space using fixed and nonlinear dynamical
systems, called reservoirs. In the literature, there are various types of
reservoirs ranging from in-silico to in-vitro. In cheminformatics, previous
studies contributed to the field by developing simulation-based chemically
inspired in-silico reservoir models. Yahiro used a DNA-based chemical reaction
network as its reservoir and Nguyen developed a DNA chemistry-inspired tool
based on Gillespie algorithm. However, these software tools were designed
mainly with the focus on DNA chemistry and their maintenance status has limited
their current usability. Due to these limitations, there was a need for a
proper open-source tool. This study introduces ChemReservoir, an open-source
framework for chemically-inspired reservoir computing. In contrast to the
former studies focused on DNA-chemistry, ChemReservoir is a general framework
for the construction and analysis of chemically-inspired reservoirs, which also
addresses the limitations in these previous studies by ensuring enhanced
testing, evaluation, and reproducibility. The tool was evaluated using various
cycle-based reservoir topologies and demonstrated stable performance across a
range of configurations in memory capacity tasks.

TL;DR: 提出FlashDMoE，一种新的Mixture-of-Experts模型实现方式，显著提高了GPU利用率和处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) 模型实现存在低GPU利用率、显著的延迟开销以及无法利用任务局部性的限制。

Method: 开发了FlashDMoE，这是一个完全驻留在GPU上的MoE操作符，它将专家计算和跨GPU通信融合到一个单一的持久GPU内核中。

Result: 在单个8-H100 GPU节点上评估时，FlashDMoE相比最先进的基线实现了高达6倍的更低延迟、5.7倍更高的吞吐量、4倍更好的弱扩展效率和9倍更高的GPU利用率，尽管使用的是FP32，而基线使用的是FP16。

Conclusion: FlashDMoE表明，原则性的GPU内核硬件协同设计是解锁大规模分布式ML工作负载性能上限的关键。

Abstract: The computational sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models enables
sub-linear growth in compute cost as model size increases, offering a scalable
path to training massive neural networks. However, existing implementations
suffer from \emph{low GPU utilization}, \emph{significant latency overhead},
and a fundamental \emph{inability to leverage task locality}, primarily due to
CPU-managed scheduling, host-initiated communication, and frequent kernel
launches. To overcome these limitations, we develop FlashDMoE, a fully
GPU-resident MoE operator that fuses expert computation and inter-GPU
communication into a \emph{single persistent GPU kernel}. FlashDMoE enables
fine-grained pipelining of dispatch, compute, and combine phases, eliminating
launch overheads and reducing idle gaps. Its device-initiated communication
protocol introduces \emph{payload-efficient} data transfers, significantly
shrinking buffer sizes in sparsely activated MoE layers. When evaluated on a
single 8-H100 GPU node with MoE models having up to 128 experts and 16K token
sequences, FlashDMoE achieves up to \textbf{6}x lower latency, \textbf{5,7}x
higher throughput, \textbf{4}x better weak scaling efficiency, and \textbf{9}x
higher GPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art baselines, despite using
FP32 while baselines use FP16. FlashDMoE demonstrates that principled GPU
kernel-hardware co-design is key to unlocking the performance ceiling of
large-scale distributed ML workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有BGP异常检测方法需要专家解读事件并提出补救措施的问题，提供自动化的解决方案。

Method: 引入BEAR框架，利用大型语言模型将表格形式的BGP数据转化为详细的文本叙述，同时开发合成数据生成框架以应对公开文档中BGP异常记录的稀缺性。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的评估显示，BEAR实现了100%的准确率，优于链式思维和上下文学习基准。

Conclusion: 此工作开创了解释BGP异常事件的自动化方法，为网络管理提供了宝贵的运行洞察。

Abstract: The Internet comprises of interconnected, independently managed Autonomous
Systems (AS) that rely on the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for inter-domain
routing. BGP anomalies--such as route leaks and hijacks--can divert traffic
through unauthorized or inefficient paths, jeopardizing network reliability and
security. Although existing rule-based and machine learning methods can detect
these anomalies using structured metrics, they still require experts with
in-depth BGP knowledge of, for example, AS relationships and historical
incidents, to interpret events and propose remediation. In this paper, we
introduce BEAR (BGP Event Analysis and Reporting), a novel framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate comprehensive
reports explaining detected BGP anomaly events. BEAR employs a multi-step
reasoning process that translates tabular BGP data into detailed textual
narratives, enhancing interpretability and analytical precision. To address the
limited availability of publicly documented BGP anomalies, we also present a
synthetic data generation framework powered by LLMs. Evaluations on both real
and synthetic datasets demonstrate that BEAR achieves 100% accuracy,
outperforming Chain-of-Thought and in-context learning baselines. This work
pioneers an automated approach for explaining BGP anomaly events, offering
valuable operational insights for network management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要集中在静态WiFi 7网络配置下的性能分析和吞吐量优化，而对具有MLO能力的密集WiFi 7网络中的动态信道分配问题关注较少。

Method: 提出Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree Search (BAI-MCTS)算法并进行了理论分析；然后通过集成大语言模型提出了LLM-BAI-MCTS算法。

Result: 提出的BAI-MCTS算法比最先进的算法快约50.44%达到最优值的98%，并且LLM-BAI-MCTS算法在密集网络中的收敛速度提高了超过63.32%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在密集WiFi 7网络的动态信道分配问题上表现出色，并且通过结合大语言模型进一步提高了性能。

Abstract: WiFi networks have achieved remarkable success in enabling seamless
communication and data exchange worldwide. The IEEE 802.11be standard, known as
WiFi 7, introduces Multi-Link Operation (MLO), a groundbreaking feature that
enables devices to establish multiple simultaneous connections across different
bands and channels. While MLO promises substantial improvements in network
throughput and latency reduction, it presents significant challenges in channel
allocation, particularly in dense network environments. Current research has
predominantly focused on performance analysis and throughput optimization
within static WiFi 7 network configurations. In contrast, this paper addresses
the dynamic channel allocation problem in dense WiFi 7 networks with MLO
capabilities. We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization
problem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism. Given the
inherent lack of prior network information, we model the problem within a
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework to enable online learning of optimal channel
allocations. Our proposed Best-Arm Identification-enabled Monte Carlo Tree
Search (BAI-MCTS) algorithm includes rigorous theoretical analysis, providing
upper bounds for both sample complexity and error probability. To further
reduce sample complexity and enhance generalizability across diverse network
scenarios, we put forth LLM-BAI-MCTS, an intelligent algorithm for the dynamic
channel allocation problem by integrating the Large Language Model (LLM) into
the BAI-MCTS algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the BAI-MCTS
algorithm achieves a convergence rate approximately $50.44\%$ faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithms when reaching $98\%$ of the optimal value. Notably,
the convergence rate of the LLM-BAI-MCTS algorithm increases by over $63.32\%$
in dense networks.

Abstract: Data has become a critical asset in the digital economy, yet it remains
underutilized by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), unlike Over-the-Top (OTT)
players that lead global market valuations. To move beyond the commoditization
of connectivity and deliver greater value to customers, data analytics emerges
as a strategic enabler. Using data efficiently is essential for unlocking new
service opportunities, optimizing operational efficiency, and mitigating
operational and business risks. Since Release 15, the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced the Network Data Analytics Function
(NWDAF) to provide powerful insights and predictions using data collected
across mobile networks, supporting both user-centric and network-oriented use
cases. However, academic research has largely focused on a limited set of
methods and use cases, driven by the availability of datasets, restricting
broader exploration. This study analyzes trends and gaps in more than 70
articles and proposes two novel use cases to promote the adoption of NWDAF and
explore its potential for monetization.

TL;DR: Introduce AbBiBench, a benchmarking framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Evaluate antibody designs by measuring protein model's likelihood on antibody-antigen complexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing antibody evaluation strategies rely on antibody alone and its similarity to natural ones, but neglect the functional unit of antibody-antigen complex.

Method: Curate, standardize, and share 9 datasets with 9 antigens and 155,853 heavy chain mutated antibodies. Systematically compare 14 protein models using correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity values.

Result: Structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity correlation and generation tasks.

Conclusion: AbBiBench provides a unified, biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

Abstract: We introduce AbBiBench (Antibody Binding Benchmarking), a benchmarking
framework for antibody binding affinity maturation and design. Unlike existing
antibody evaluation strategies that rely on antibody alone and its similarity
to natural ones (e.g., amino acid identity rate, structural RMSD), AbBiBench
considers an antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) complex as a functional unit and
evaluates the potential of an antibody design binding to given antigen by
measuring protein model's likelihood on the Ab-Ag complex. We first curate,
standardize, and share 9 datasets containing 9 antigens (involving influenza,
anti-lysozyme, HER2, VEGF, integrin, and SARS-CoV-2) and 155,853 heavy chain
mutated antibodies. Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein
models including masked language models, autoregressive language models,
inverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph
models. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity
values is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to
increase binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we
evaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of
new antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural
integrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,
structure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity
correlation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,
biologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of
more effective, function-aware antibody design models.

### [311] [The Latent Space Hypothesis: Toward Universal Medical Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04515)
*Salil Patel*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This paper discusses how different types of medical data can be interpreted within a shared geometric representation to support personalized diagnosis and treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled way to re-examine conditions like Parkinson's or Crohn's that may involve multiple pathophysiological entities and broader anatomical domains.

Method: Using the Latent Space Hypothesis to interpret heterogeneous evidence in a shared space.

Result: The framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalized diagnosis, longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment.

Conclusion: Challenges remain but there are plausible paths forward such as scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and perturbation-based validation.

Abstract: Medical data range from genomic sequences and retinal photographs to
structured laboratory results and unstructured clinical narratives. Although
these modalities appear disparate, many encode convergent information about a
single underlying physiological state. The Latent Space Hypothesis frames each
observation as a projection of a unified, hierarchically organized manifold --
much like shadows cast by the same three-dimensional object. Within this
learned geometric representation, an individual's health status occupies a
point, disease progression traces a trajectory, and therapeutic intervention
corresponds to a directed vector. Interpreting heterogeneous evidence in a
shared space provides a principled way to re-examine eponymous conditions --
such as Parkinson's or Crohn's -- that often mask multiple pathophysiological
entities and involve broader anatomical domains than once believed. By
revealing sub-trajectories and patient-specific directions of change, the
framework supplies a quantitative rationale for personalised diagnosis,
longitudinal monitoring, and tailored treatment, moving clinical practice away
from grouping by potentially misleading labels toward navigation of each
person's unique trajectory. Challenges remain -- bias amplification, data
scarcity for rare disorders, privacy, and the correlation-causation divide --
but scale-aware encoders, continual learning on longitudinal data streams, and
perturbation-based validation offer plausible paths forward.

Abstract: A common practice of ML systems development concerns the training of the same
model under different data sets, and the use of the same (training and test)
sets for different learning models. The first case is a desirable practice for
identifying high quality and unbiased training conditions. The latter case
coincides with the search for optimal models under a common dataset for
training. These differently obtained systems have been considered akin to
copies. In the quest for responsible AI, a legitimate but hardly investigated
question is how to verify that trustworthiness is preserved by copies. In this
paper we introduce a calculus to model and verify probabilistic complex queries
over data and define four distinct notions: Justifiably, Equally, Weakly and
Almost Trustworthy which can be checked analysing the (partial) behaviour of
the copy with respect to its original. We provide a study of the relations
between these notions of trustworthiness, and how they compose with each other
and under logical operations. The aim is to offer a computational tool to check
the trustworthiness of possibly complex systems copied from an original whose
behavour is known.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify geodesic curves that best capture variations in a dataset of probability distributions.

Method: For Gaussians, lifts computations to invertible linear maps; for general cases, uses neural networks to parameterize geodesics.

Result: Compares GPCA with tangent PCA through examples and provides illustrations on real-world data.

Conclusion: GPCA offers a novel way to analyze variations in probability distributions compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) on a
collection of probability distributions using the Otto-Wasserstein geometry.
The goal is to identify geodesic curves in the space of probability measures
that best capture the modes of variation of the underlying dataset. We first
address the case of a collection of Gaussian distributions, and show how to
lift the computations in the space of invertible linear maps. For the more
general setting of absolutely continuous probability measures, we leverage a
novel approach to parameterizing geodesics in Wasserstein space with neural
networks. Finally, we compare to classical tangent PCA through various examples
and provide illustrations on real-world datasets.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper introduces two novel model-free RL algorithms called Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost which achieve the best near-optimal regret among all known model-free RL or FRL algorithms while also having low burn-in cost and logarithmic policy switching or communication cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the high costs associated with data collection and policy deployment in real-world settings, particularly in single-agent and federated reinforcement learning.

Method: Two new algorithms called Q-EarlySettled-LowCost and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost are proposed that simultaneously achieve near-optimal regret, low burn-in cost, and logarithmic policy switching or communication cost.

Result: The proposed algorithms are the first to achieve these properties simultaneously and also establish gap-dependent theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs.

Conclusion: This paper provides a significant advancement in the field of reinforcement learning by introducing algorithms that address the costly aspects of data collection and policy deployment.

Abstract: Motivated by real-world settings where data collection and policy deployment
-- whether for a single agent or across multiple agents -- are costly, we study
the problem of on-policy single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) and federated
RL (FRL) with a focus on minimizing burn-in costs (the sample sizes needed to
reach near-optimal regret) and policy switching or communication costs. In
parallel finite-horizon episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with $S$
states and $A$ actions, existing methods either require superlinear burn-in
costs in $S$ and $A$ or fail to achieve logarithmic switching or communication
costs. We propose two novel model-free RL algorithms -- Q-EarlySettled-LowCost
and FedQ-EarlySettled-LowCost -- that are the first in the literature to
simultaneously achieve: (i) the best near-optimal regret among all known
model-free RL or FRL algorithms, (ii) low burn-in cost that scales linearly
with $S$ and $A$, and (iii) logarithmic policy switching cost for single-agent
RL or communication cost for FRL. Additionally, we establish gap-dependent
theoretical guarantees for both regret and switching/communication costs,
improving or matching the best-known gap-dependent bounds.

Conclusion: DE is complementary to recent advances in Bayesian optimization over discrete and mixed-spaces.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a popular and sample-efficient approach
for many engineering applications, where observations are expensive to acquire,
and is also a central ingredient of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly
prevailing method for the optimization of black-box functions. However, when
all or some input variables are categorical, building a predictive and
computationally efficient GP remains challenging. Starting from the naive
target encoding idea, where the original categorical values are replaced with
the mean of the target variable for that category, we propose a generalization
based on distributional encoding (DE) which makes use of all samples of the
target variable for a category. To handle this type of encoding inside the GP,
we build upon recent results on characteristic kernels for probability
distributions, based on the maximum mean discrepancy and the Wasserstein
distance. We also discuss several extensions for classification, multi-task
learning and incorporation or auxiliary information. Our approach is validated
empirically, and we demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive performance on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets. DE is naturally complementary to
recent advances in BO over discrete and mixed-spaces.

*Armin Kekić,Sergio Hernan Garrido Mejia,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This study presents a way to estimate joint causal effects using only observational data and single-variable interventions by proposing a practical estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating causal effects of joint interventions on multiple variables is crucial in many domains but obtaining data from such simultaneous interventions can be challenging.

Method: An identifiability result is presented and a practical estimator is proposed which decomposes the causal effect into confounded and unconfounded contributions for each intervention variable.

Result: Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to models trained directly on joint interventional data, outperforming a purely observational estimator.

Conclusion: Joint effects can be inferred without access to joint interventional data for a class of nonlinear additive outcome mechanisms.

*Konstantin Göbler,Tobias Windisch,Mathias Drton*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data is challenging, especially when dealing with vector data instead of scalar random variables. This paper extends nonlinear additive noise models to handle random vectors, proposing a two-step approach for causal graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to infer cause-effect relationships from observational data in domains where the causal units are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.

Method: A two-step approach for causal graph learning: (1) infer the causal order among random vectors, and (2) perform model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. Effective and novel solutions are introduced for both steps in the vector case.

Result: Strong performance is demonstrated in simulations, and the method is applied to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering among variable groups.

Conclusion: This work extends nonlinear additive noise models to handle random vectors, providing a new approach for causal graph learning in complex domains.

Abstract: Inferring cause-effect relationships from observational data has gained
significant attention in recent years, but most methods are limited to scalar
random variables. In many important domains, including neuroscience,
psychology, social science, and industrial manufacturing, the causal units of
interest are groups of variables rather than individual scalar measurements.
Motivated by these applications, we extend nonlinear additive noise models to
handle random vectors, establishing a two-step approach for causal graph
learning: First, infer the causal order among random vectors. Second, perform
model selection to identify the best graph consistent with this order. We
introduce effective and novel solutions for both steps in the vector case,
demonstrating strong performance in simulations. Finally, we apply our method
to real-world assembly line data with partial knowledge of causal ordering
among variable groups.

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable
Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants,
addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent
confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the
treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer
instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are
identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding
estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and
robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the
theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems
with latent confounders.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: This paper shows that adaptive designs can universally and strictly dominate completely randomized trials in the best-arm identification problem with at least three treatment arms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether ignoring the option of running an adaptive trial in favor of a non-adaptive trial is admissible.

Method: Analyzing the class of batched arm elimination designs and their domination over completely randomized trials.

Result: Simple adaptive designs can universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely randomized trials.

Conclusion: The results solve an open problem and highlight the importance of using adaptive designs in certain scenarios.

Abstract: When an experimenter has the option of running an adaptive trial, is it
admissible to ignore this option and run a non-adaptive trial instead? We
provide a negative answer to this question in the best-arm identification
problem, where the experimenter aims to allocate measurement efforts
judiciously to confidently deploy the most effective treatment arm. We find
that, whenever there are at least three treatment arms, there exist simple
adaptive designs that universally and strictly dominate non-adaptive completely
randomized trials. This dominance is characterized by a notion called
efficiency exponent, which quantifies a design's statistical efficiency when
the experimental sample is large. Our analysis focuses on the class of batched
arm elimination designs, which progressively eliminate underperforming arms at
pre-specified batch intervals. We characterize simple sufficient conditions
under which these designs universally and strictly dominate completely
randomized trials. These results resolve the second open problem posed in Qin
[2022].

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This study examines the performance drop of audio-text models in classifying environmental sounds when background sound sources are present. It introduces a new approach to consider background contributions in the classification process, improving accuracy under different background types and signal-to-noise ratios without needing model retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance degradation of audio-text models in classifying environmental sounds with background sound sources.

Method: Proposes a method to quantify and integrate the contribution of background sources into the classification process.

Result: Improves classification accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions without model retraining.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively narrows the modality gap between audio and text embeddings and generalizes well across state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Audio-text models are widely used in zero-shot environmental sound
classification as they alleviate the need for annotated data. However, we show
that their performance severely drops in the presence of background sound
sources. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by SNR
levels of background soundscapes, and independent of background type. To
address this, we propose a novel method that quantifies and integrates the
contribution of background sources into the classification process, improving
performance without requiring model retraining. Our domain adaptation technique
enhances accuracy across various backgrounds and SNR conditions. Moreover, we
analyze the modality gap between audio and text embeddings, showing that
narrowing this gap improves classification performance. The method generalizes
effectively across state-of-the-art prototypical approaches, showcasing its
scalability and robustness for diverse environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过图元条件生成音素和韵律标签的模型，并验证了其在口音估计等下游任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法保证语音标签与图元的一致性，限制了其在下游任务中的应用。

Method: 通过提示编码器添加隐式图元条件，并在推理过程中显式剪枝与图元不一致的标签假设。

Result: 提出的模型显著提高了图元与预测标签之间的一致性，并有效提升了口音估计任务的准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究为文本到语音和其他下游任务提供了高质量的平行数据。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大型语言模型的音素到字母解码方法，解决了基于加权有限状态转换器的解码限制，并在跨语言ASR任务中展示了良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别中的音素基础多语言预训练和跨语言微调因其高效的数据使用率和具有竞争力的结果而具有吸引力，但基于加权有限状态转换器（WFST）的解码受到其复杂管道和无法利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的限制。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型的音素到字母（LLM-P2G）解码方法，该方法包括语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字母（P2G）。此外，还提出了两种训练策略：带有噪声音素的数据增强（DANP），以及随机Top-K边缘化（TKM）训练和解码。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM-P2G在跨语言ASR任务中对于波兰语和德语相比基于WFST的系统分别实现了相对WER减少3.6%和6.9%。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G在跨语言ASR任务中对波兰语和德语相比基于WFST的系统分别实现了相对WER减少3.6%和6.9%

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to improve AI music generation models by incorporating user feedback through a genetic algorithm, showing significant improvement in user ratings after two iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of interpreting and responding to user input accurately in AI music generation, which is crucial due to the subjectivity and need for personalization in music.

Method: A genetic algorithm is used to incorporate user feedback for fine-tuning the model.

Result: The approach resulted in an average rating increase of 0.2 in the first iteration and an additional increase of 0.39 in the second iteration compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed human-computation approach using a genetic algorithm that incorporates user feedback improves the performance of AI music generation models.

Abstract: AI music generation has advanced rapidly, with models like diffusion and
autoregressive algorithms enabling high-fidelity outputs. These tools can alter
styles, mix instruments, or isolate them. Since sound can be visualized as
spectrograms, image-generation algorithms can be applied to generate novel
music. However, these algorithms are typically trained on fixed datasets, which
makes it challenging for them to interpret and respond to user input
accurately. This is especially problematic because music is highly subjective
and requires a level of personalization that image generation does not provide.
In this work, we propose a human-computation approach to gradually improve the
performance of these algorithms based on user interactions. The
human-computation element involves aggregating and selecting user ratings to
use as the loss function for fine-tuning the model. We employ a genetic
algorithm that incorporates user feedback to enhance the baseline performance
of a model initially trained on a fixed dataset. The effectiveness of this
approach is measured by the average increase in user ratings with each
iteration. In the pilot test, the first iteration showed an average rating
increase of 0.2 compared to the baseline. The second iteration further improved
upon this, achieving an additional increase of 0.39 over the first iteration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs have difficulty capturing complex spatial hierarchies and enforcing intricate boundary conditions.

Method: BridgeNet uses adaptive CNN layers for local feature extraction and includes a dynamically weighted loss function to enforce physical constraints.

Result: BridgeNet shows significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: This paper presents a significant advancement in computational physics by offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with potential applications in financial mathematics and complex system dynamics.

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural
networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear,
high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which
typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture
complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In
contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature
extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that
rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments
across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves
significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to
conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in
high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in
computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology
with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to

Motivation: To address the underexplored area of vulnerability patching within Automated Program Repair (APR), which is crucial for software security.

Method: Investigating pre-trained language models CodeBERT and CodeT5 for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets and four languages.

Result: Both models struggle with fragmented or sparse context, but CodeBERT performs better in these scenarios and CodeT5 captures complex vulnerability patterns and shows superior scalability. Fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance but models struggle to generalize to unseen data.

Conclusion: This research benchmarks model performance, highlights limitations in generalization, and offers insights to improve automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose significant security threats, requiring
effective mitigation. While Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced in
fixing general bugs, vulnerability patching, a security-critical aspect of APR
remains underexplored. This study investigates pre-trained language models,
CodeBERT and CodeT5, for automated vulnerability patching across six datasets
and four languages. We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown
vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with
fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such
scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns.
CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned
models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen)
datasets. While fine-tuning improves in-distribution performance, models
struggle to generalize to unseen data, highlighting challenges in robust
vulnerability detection. This study benchmarks model performance, identifies
limitations in generalization, and provides actionable insights to advance
automated vulnerability patching for real-world security applications.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoRAL, a deep learning framework for automating code review comment generation using reinforcement learning, which considers both semantic similarity and usefulness for code refinement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code review is essential but time-consuming and subjective; automation through deep learning can enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Exploits reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism that evaluates both semantic similarity of generated comments and their effectiveness for code refinement tasks.

Result: CoRAL outperforms existing baseline techniques in generating meaningful and useful code review comments.

Conclusion: The proposed CoRAL framework demonstrates effectiveness and superiority in automating code review comment generation by integrating reinforcement learning with a dual-reward system.

Abstract: Code review is a crucial component of modern software development, involving
the evaluation of code quality, providing feedback on potential issues, and
refining the code to address identified problems. Despite these benefits, code
review can be rather time consuming, and influenced by subjectivity and human
factors. For these reasons, techniques to (partially) automate the code review
process have been proposed in the literature. Among those, the ones exploiting
deep learning (DL) are able to tackle the generative aspect of code review, by
commenting on a given code as a human reviewer would do (i.e., comment
generation task) or by automatically implementing code changes required to
address a reviewer's comment (i.e., code refinement task). In this paper, we
introduce CoRAL, a deep learning framework automating review comment generation
by exploiting reinforcement learning with a reward mechanism considering both
the semantics of the generated comments as well as their usefulness as input
for other models automating the code refinement task. The core idea is that if
the DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected
ones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code
refinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus
deserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework. We present
both quantitative and qualitative comparisons between the comments generated by
CoRAL and those produced by the latest baseline techniques, highlighting the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

Result: A tailored combination of techniques yields significant performance gains, and the developed TQml Simulator outperforms Pennylane's simulator by 2-100 times depending on various factors.

Conclusion: The optimal simulation method varies with the number of qubits, and a specialized combination of techniques improves simulation efficiency.

Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are
typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed
numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in
this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific
techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state
vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine
Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for
a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a
tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in
the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these
insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that
employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit.
We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets,
such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM
quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent
Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending
on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the
hardware used.

TL;DR: This paper examines whether public instruments for measuring representational harms in LLM-based systems meet practitioners' needs, finding that challenges like misalignment and practical barriers prevent widespread usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if publicly available instruments for measuring representational harms in LLM-based systems fulfill the needs of practitioners.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 practitioners in the field.

Result: Practitioners face two types of challenges: instruments either don't measure what's needed or are hindered by practical and institutional barriers.

Conclusion: Recommendations based on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement are provided to address these challenges and better meet practitioner needs.

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

TL;DR: AI systems pose challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how to responsibly deploy agent-based AI systems.

Method: Mixed-methods approach including literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles.

Result: Agent oversight presents intensified governance challenges like continuous oversight, deeper integration, and interdepartmental coordination.

Conclusion: Proposes approaches to adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight compatible with public sector constraints.

Abstract: This paper finds that the introduction of agentic AI systems intensifies
existing challenges to traditional public sector oversight mechanisms -- which
rely on siloed compliance units and episodic approvals rather than continuous,
integrated supervision. We identify five governance dimensions essential for
responsible agent deployment: cross-departmental implementation, comprehensive
evaluation, enhanced security protocols, operational visibility, and systematic
auditing. We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet
these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature
review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that
agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance
challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and
operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination. We propose
approaches that both adapt institutional structures and design agent oversight
compatible with public sector constraints.

Motivation: To challenge the assumption that outputs from large AI models should receive First Amendment protections.

Method: Analyzing the nature of AI-generated content and its implications on legal precedents and free speech principles.

Result: Concludes that AI model outputs do not constitute speech under existing law and extending such rights would be harmful to societal regulation of AI technologies.

Conclusion: AI model outputs lack intentionality and thus cannot be considered speech for First Amendment protection; extending these rights would impede effective governance and increase potential harms.

Abstract: This paper challenges the assumption that courts should grant First Amendment
protections to outputs from large generative AI models, such as GPT-4 and
Gemini. We argue that because these models lack intentionality, their outputs
do not constitute speech as understood in the context of established legal
precedent, so there can be no speech to protect. Furthermore, if the model
outputs are not speech, users cannot claim a First Amendment speech right to
receive the outputs. We also argue that extending First Amendment rights to AI
models would not serve the fundamental purposes of free speech, such as
promoting a marketplace of ideas, facilitating self-governance, or fostering
self-expression. In fact, granting First Amendment protections to AI models
would be detrimental to society because it would hinder the government's
ability to regulate these powerful technologies effectively, potentially
leading to the unchecked spread of misinformation and other harms.

### [333] [GARG-AML against Smurfing: A Scalable and Interpretable Graph-Based Framework for Anti-Money Laundering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04292)
*Bruno Deprez,Bart Baesens,Tim Verdonck,Wouter Verbeke*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A novel graph-based method named GARG-AML is introduced to quantify smurfing risk. It balances computational efficiency, detection power and transparency, outperforming current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of money laundering which accounts for 2%-5% of the global GDP and to evade regulatory controls using smurfing method.

Method: Introduce GARG-AML, a graph-based method that calculates a single interpretable metric from the second-order transaction network of each node.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods in experiments on large-scale synthetic and open-source networks.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of fundamental network properties in advancing fraud detection.

Abstract: Money laundering poses a significant challenge as it is estimated to account
for 2%-5% of the global GDP. This has compelled regulators to impose stringent
controls on financial institutions. One prominent laundering method for evading
these controls, called smurfing, involves breaking up large transactions into
smaller amounts. Given the complexity of smurfing schemes, which involve
multiple transactions distributed among diverse parties, network analytics has
become an important anti-money laundering tool. However, recent advances have
focused predominantly on black-box network embedding methods, which has
hindered their adoption in businesses. In this paper, we introduce GARG-AML, a
novel graph-based method that quantifies smurfing risk through a single
interpretable metric derived from the structure of the second-order transaction
network of each individual node in the network. Unlike traditional methods,
GARG-AML strikes an effective balance among computational efficiency, detection
power and transparency, which enables its integration into existing AML
workflows. To enhance its capabilities, we combine the GARG-AML score
calculation with different tree-based methods and also incorporate the scores
of the node's neighbours. An experimental evaluation on large-scale synthetic
and open-source networks demonstrate that the GARG-AML outperforms the current
state-of-the-art smurfing detection methods. By leveraging only the adjacency
matrix of the second-order neighbourhood and basic network features, this work
highlights the potential of fundamental network properties towards advancing
fraud detection.

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了物理自组织与人工智能之间的深刻联系，通过光子计算实现了高效计算路径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework connecting
optical physics equations to generative models, demonstrating how light
propagation dynamics inspire powerful artificial intelligence approaches. We
analyze six fundamental optical equations, comparing linear models (Helmholtz,
dissipative wave, and Eikonal equations) with their nonlinear extensions
incorporating Kerr effects, cubic-quintic nonlinearities, and
intensity-dependent refractive indices. Our nonlinear optical models reveal
remarkable capabilities through natural self-organization principles. The
nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves 40-60% parameter reduction while maintaining
superior mode separation via self-focusing phenomena. The cubic-quintic
dissipative wave model prevents mode collapse through balanced
attractive-repulsive interactions, enabling stable soliton formation with
20-40% improved coverage. The intensity-dependent Eikonal model creates
adaptive pathways that dynamically respond to content, providing enhanced
controllability in conditional generation. Experimental validation demonstrates
consistent superiority over linear predecessors and traditional generative
approaches. The nonlinear Helmholtz model achieves FID scores of 0.0089 versus
1.0909 for linear versions, while the cubic-quintic model reaches 0.0156 FID
with exceptional stability. Memory usage drops 40-60% and training time
improves 30-50% due to inherent nonlinear stability properties. The framework
enables bidirectional benefits, advancing both generative AI and optical
physics through novel approaches to soliton analysis, wavefront control, and
refractive index reconstruction with 95% accuracy. This work reveals deep
connections between physical self-organization and artificial intelligence,
opening pathways toward efficient optical computing implementations.

*Sydney Anuyah*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the relationship between socioeconomic factors and the type of crime experienced using data from 1992 to 2022. Higher income and education reduce the likelihood of violent crime, while men, younger individuals, and minorities face higher risks. Geographic differences also exist, with suburbs having the best predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how socioeconomic factors and demographics influence the type of crime experienced.

Method: Balanced classification splits and logistic regression models evaluated by F1-score were used to isolate socioeconomic drivers and introduce demographic factor controls.

Result: Higher income and education lower the odds of violent crime. Men, younger individuals, and minorities face higher violent crime risks. Suburbs have the strongest predictive performance.

Conclusion: Specific interventions such as educational investments in metropolitan settings, economic support in rural communities, and demographic-aware prevention strategies are needed.

Abstract: In this short article, I leverage the National Crime Victimization Survey
from 1992 to 2022 to examine how income, education, employment, and key
demographic factors shape the type of crime victims experience (violent vs
property). Using balanced classification splits and logistic regression models
evaluated by F1-score, there is an isolation of the socioeconomic drivers of
victimization "Group A" models and then an introduction of demographic factors
such as age, gender, race, and marital status controls called "Group B" models.
The results consistently proves that higher income and education lower the odds
of violent relative to property crime, while men younger individuals and racial
minorities face disproportionately higher violentcrime risks. On the geographic
spectrum, the suburban models achieve the strongest predictive performance with
an accuracy of 0.607 and F1 of 0.590, urban areas benefit from adding education
and employment predictors and crime in rural areas are still unpredictable
using these current factors. The patterns found in this study shows the need
for specific interventions like educational investments in metropolitan
settings economic support in rural communities and demographicaware prevention
strategies.

Motivation: To preserve the structural fidelity of the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a reference image, and to ensure uniform visual difficulty across timesteps for more balanced and faithful reconstructions.

Method: A novel diffusion-based framework that introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion) for automatic colorization of Anime-style facial sketches.

Result: Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset show superior performance in pixel accuracy and perceptual quality compared to other methods.

Conclusion: Our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for automatic colorization of
Anime-style facial sketches. Our method preserves the structural fidelity of
the input sketch while effectively transferring stylistic attributes from a
reference image. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on predefined noise
schedules - which often compromise perceptual consistency -- our framework
builds on continuous-time diffusion models and introduces SSIMBaD (Sigma
Scaling with SSIM-Guided Balanced Diffusion). SSIMBaD applies a sigma-space
transformation that aligns perceptual degradation, as measured by structural
similarity (SSIM), in a linear manner. This scaling ensures uniform visual
difficulty across timesteps, enabling more balanced and faithful
reconstructions. Experiments on a large-scale Anime face dataset demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both pixel accuracy and
perceptual quality, while generalizing to diverse styles. Code is available at

Abstract: This work focuses on estimating soil properties from water moisture
measurements. We consider simulated data generated by solving the
initial-boundary value problem governing vertical infiltration in a
homogeneous, bounded soil profile, with the usage of the Fokas method. To
address the parameter identification problem, which is formulated as a

performance of each model is assessed under different data conditions: full,
noisy, and limited. Overall, the prediction of diffusivity $D$ tends to be more
accurate than that of hydraulic conductivity $K.$ Among the models considered,
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) demonstrate the

*Conor Rowan,John Evans,Kurt Maute,Alireza Doostan*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method using neural network discretizations to solve eigenvalue problems, emphasizing the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems are common in engineering but have been less studied in physics-informed machine learning. The paper aims to address this gap by proposing a new approach.

Method: Using a neural network discretization of the eigenfunction, the authors employ the Rayleigh quotient and Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure to solve eigenvalue problems.

Result: The method proves effective for various types of eigenproblems including parametric, nonlinear, and high-dimensional cases, and demonstrates potential as a spectral basis for PDE solutions.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a robust and simple way to handle continuous eigenvalue problems, showing promise across multiple engineering applications.

Abstract: From characterizing the speed of a thermal system's response to computing
natural modes of vibration, eigenvalue analysis is ubiquitous in engineering.
In spite of this, eigenvalue problems have received relatively little treatment
compared to standard forward and inverse problems in the physics-informed
machine learning literature. In particular, neural network discretizations of
solutions to eigenvalue problems have seen only a handful of studies. Owing to
their nonlinearity, neural network discretizations prevent the conversion of
the continuous eigenvalue differential equation into a standard discrete
eigenvalue problem. In this setting, eigenvalue analysis requires more
specialized techniques. Using a neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction, we show that a variational form of the eigenvalue problem called
the "Rayleigh quotient" in tandem with a Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
procedure is a particularly simple and robust approach to find the eigenvalues
and their corresponding eigenfunctions. This method is shown to be useful for
finding sets of harmonic functions on irregular domains, parametric and
nonlinear eigenproblems, and high-dimensional eigenanalysis. We also discuss
the utility of harmonic functions as a spectral basis for approximating
solutions to partial differential equations. Through various examples from
engineering mechanics, the combination of the Rayleigh quotient objective,
Gram-Schmidt procedure, and the neural network discretization of the
eigenfunction is shown to offer unique advantages for handling continuous
eigenvalue problems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Exp4Fuse, a novel fusion ranking framework that uses zero-shot large language models to enhance sparse retrievers for query expansion, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and computational intensity associated with complex prompt strategies and dense retrieval techniques in enhancing information retrieval performance.

Method: Introducing a novel fusion ranking framework named Exp4Fuse, which uses zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to enhance sparse retrievers.

Result: Exp4Fuse improves sparse retrievers and achieves superior performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods and achieves SOTA results on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: This paper presents GOLFer, a novel method using smaller open-source LMs for query expansion in information retrieval. GOLFer includes a hallucination filter to detect and remove non-factual sentences in generated documents and a documents combiner to balance their influence with the query.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost, computational intensity, and limited accessibility of LLM-based query expansion methods.

Method: GOLFer, which consists of a hallucination filter and a documents combiner.

Result: GOLFer outperforms other methods using smaller LMs and maintains competitive performance against methods using large-size LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed GOLFer method demonstrates effectiveness in query expansion using smaller LMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: To address the issue of excessive memory usage caused by encoding each page into multiple patch-level embeddings in ColPali/ColQwen2 for Visualized Document Retrieval (VDR).

Method: Two token-reduction strategies were evaluated: token pruning and token merging. For token merging, the authors searched for optimal combinations across three dimensions and developed Light-ColPali/ColQwen2.

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 retains 98.2% of retrieval performance with only 11.8% of the original memory usage, and at 2.8% memory footprint, it preserves 94.6% effectiveness.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 achieves significant memory efficiency while maintaining high retrieval performance, providing a competitive baseline for efficient VDR.

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

### [344] [Reason-to-Recommend: Using Interaction-of-Thought Reasoning to Enhance LLM Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05069)
*Keyu Zhao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Introduce R2Rec, a novel reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework leveraging LLMs to improve performance and interpretability on implicit feedback tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation tasks is appealing due to their strong semantic understanding and prompt flexibility. While LLM reasoning has been successful in fields like math and code, applying similar reasoning methods directly to recommendations is challenging because user feedback is implicit and lacks clear reasoning supervision.

Method: R2Rec, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and transforms them into structured interaction-of-thoughts using a progressive masked prompting strategy. Each thought represents stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction context, allowing LLMs to mimic step-by-step decision-making based on implicit patterns.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that R2Rec surpasses classical and LLM-based baselines, improving HitRatio@1 by 10.48% on average and achieving a 131.81% gain over the original LLM. The explicit reasoning chains also improve interpretability by showing the decision process.

Conclusion: R2Rec effectively enhances recommendation performance through reasoning augmentation, addressing the challenge of implicit feedback in recommendations.

Abstract: Driven by advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating them into
recommendation tasks has gained interest due to their strong semantic
understanding and prompt flexibility. Prior work encoded user-item interactions
or metadata into prompts for recommendations. In parallel, LLM reasoning,
boosted by test-time scaling and reinforcement learning, has excelled in fields
like mathematics and code, where reasoning traces and correctness signals are
clear, enabling high performance and interpretability. However, directly
applying these reasoning methods to recommendation is ineffective because user
feedback is implicit and lacks reasoning supervision. To address this, we
propose $\textbf{R2Rec}$, a reasoning-enhanced recommendation framework that
samples interaction chains from the user-item graph and converts them into
structured interaction-of-thoughts via a progressive masked prompting strategy,
with each thought representing stepwise reasoning grounded in interaction
context. This allows LLMs to simulate step-by-step decision-making based on
implicit patterns. We design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning teaches basic reasoning from high-quality traces, and reinforcement
learning refines reasoning via reward signals, alleviating sparse explicit
supervision. Experiments on three real-world datasets show R2Rec outperforms
classical and LLM-based baselines with an average $\textbf{10.48%}$ improvement
in HitRatio@1 and $\textbf{131.81%}$ gain over the original LLM. Furthermore,
the explicit reasoning chains enhance interpretability by revealing the
decision process. Our code is available at:

inquiries often produce rich data through rigorous and resource-intensive
processes, much of this data usually remains unused. In this paper, we first
make a general case for secondary analysis of qualitative data by discussing
its benefits, distinctions, and epistemological aspects. We then argue for
opportunities with computationally intensive secondary analysis, highlighting
the possibility of drawing on data assemblages spanning multiple contexts and
timeframes to address cross-contextual and longitudinal research phenomena and
questions. We propose a scheme to perform computationally intensive secondary
analysis and advance ideas on how this approach can help facilitate the

Motivation: To improve breast cancer detection accuracy using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The model uses enhanced attention mechanisms and is trained and validated on multiple datasets including an in-domain test set, a biopsy-confirmed set, and an out-of-domain generalizability set.

Result: The system achieved high AUROCs on all datasets and showed strong agreement with radiologists in clinical validation.

Conclusion: The deep learning system demonstrates effectiveness in assisting mammogram interpretation and has the potential to enhance breast cancer screening workflows.

Abstract: This study presents a deep learning system for breast cancer detection in
mammography, developed using a modified EfficientNetV2 architecture with
enhanced attention mechanisms. The model was trained on mammograms from a major
Thai medical center and validated on three distinct datasets: an in-domain test
set (9,421 cases), a biopsy-confirmed set (883 cases), and an out-of-domain
generalizability set (761 cases) collected from two different hospitals. For
cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the
respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated
using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion
Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying
suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong
agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization
concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6%
localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists'
acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for
out-of-domain cases. The system achieved a System Usability Scale score of
74.17 for source hospital, and 69.20 for validation hospitals, indicating good
clinical acceptance. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
assisting mammogram interpretation, with the potential to enhance breast cancer
screening workflows in clinical practice.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper investigates privacy risks in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) within federated learning by demonstrating gradient inversion attacks on adapter modules, showing that sensitive data can be reconstructed from shared gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore potential privacy vulnerabilities in PEFT mechanisms where only lightweight modules are updated and shared during collaborative training.

Method: Analyzing a popular PEFT method, the adapter, and performing gradient inversion attacks to retrieve fine-tuning images.

Result: The study successfully reconstructs large batches of fine-tuning images with high fidelity, indicating significant privacy concerns.

Conclusion: Highlights the necessity for privacy-preserving mechanisms in PEFT and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple data-owners to collaboratively train
machine learning models by exchanging local gradients, while keeping their
private data on-device. To simultaneously enhance privacy and training
efficiency, recently parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large-scale
pretrained models has gained substantial attention in FL. While keeping a
pretrained (backbone) model frozen, each user fine-tunes only a few lightweight
modules to be used in conjunction, to fit specific downstream applications.
Accordingly, only the gradients with respect to these lightweight modules are
shared with the server. In this work, we investigate how the privacy of the
fine-tuning data of the users can be compromised via a malicious design of the
pretrained model and trainable adapter modules. We demonstrate gradient
inversion attacks on a popular PEFT mechanism, the adapter, which allow an
attacker to reconstruct local data samples of a target user, using only the
accessible adapter gradients. Via extensive experiments, we demonstrate that a
large batch of fine-tuning images can be retrieved with high fidelity. Our
attack highlights the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms for PEFT, while
opening up several future directions. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D感知视觉语言模型RoboRefer，该模型通过整合深度编码器实现精确的空间理解，并通过强化微调提升多步空间推理能力，实验结果表明其在复杂3D场景中的表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法由于无法准确理解复杂的3D场景并动态推理指令指示的交互位置，因此在空间引用方面的能力有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为RoboRefer的3D感知视觉语言模型，该模型通过整合专用的深度编码器实现精确的空间理解，并通过特定的空间引用任务的度量敏感过程奖励函数推进多步空间推理。为了支持SFT和RFT训练，还引入了一个包含20M问答对的大规模数据集RefSpatial以及一个挑战性的基准测试RefSpatial-Bench。

Result: 经过SFT训练的RoboRefer在空间理解方面达到了最先进的水平，平均成功率为89.6%。而经过RFT训练的RoboRefer在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率比Gemini-2.5-Pro高出17.4%。

Conclusion: 实验表明，经过监督微调（SFT）的RoboRefer在空间理解方面达到了最先进的水平，平均成功率达到了89.6%。经过强化微调（RFT）的RoboRefer进一步超越了所有其他基线模型，在RefSpatial-Bench上的平均准确率比Gemini-2.5-Pro高出17.4%。并且，RoboRefer可以与各种控制策略集成，以在杂乱的真实场景中的不同机器人上执行长时间范围和动态任务。

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact
with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision
language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately
understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the
instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose
RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding
by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial
reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process
reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT
training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x
prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex
reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce
RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial
referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained
RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average
success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other
baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average
accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various
control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots
(e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

sensor suites, including multiple RGB and depth cameras, and inertial
measurement units. cuVSLAM supports operation with as few as one RGB camera to
as many as 32 cameras, in arbitrary geometric configurations, thus supporting a

deploy in real-time applications with minimal computational overhead on
edge-computing devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson. We present the design and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches relying on static models struggle with task diversity and dynamic environments in complex tasks requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation among heterogeneous robots.

Method: A hierarchical framework integrating prompted LLM and GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned VLM. The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D spatial information from aerial images.

Result: Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel hierarchical framework that combines prompted LLM and GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned VLM to achieve generalizable intelligence in heterogeneous multi-robot systems. The proposed method shows strong adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Heterogeneous multi-robot systems show great potential in complex tasks
requiring coordinated hybrid cooperation. However, traditional approaches
relying on static models often struggle with task diversity and dynamic
environments. This highlights the need for generalizable intelligence that can
bridge high-level reasoning with low-level execution across heterogeneous
agents. To address this, we propose a hierarchical framework integrating a
prompted Large Language Model (LLM) and a GridMask-enhanced fine-tuned Vision
Language Model (VLM). The LLM performs task decomposition and global semantic
map construction, while the VLM extracts task-specified semantic labels and 2D
spatial information from aerial images to support local planning. Within this
framework, the aerial robot follows a globally optimized semantic path and
continuously provides bird-view images, guiding the ground robot's local
semantic navigation and manipulation, including target-absent scenarios where
implicit alignment is maintained. Experiments on a real-world letter-cubes
arrangement task demonstrate the framework's adaptability and robustness in
dynamic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of an aerial-ground heterogeneous system integrating VLM-based
perception with LLM-driven task reasoning and motion planning.

Method: SGN-CIRL framework that uses 3D scene graphs, combined with imitation and curriculum learning to enhance reinforcement learning.

Result: Significantly increased success rates in challenging navigation tasks in the Isaac Sim environment.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise in improving robot navigation through effective use of 3D scene graphs and advanced learning techniques.

Abstract: The 3D scene graph models spatial relationships between objects, enabling the
agent to efficiently navigate in a partially observable environment and predict
the location of the target object.This paper proposes an original framework
named SGN-CIRL (3D Scene Graph-Based Reinforcement Learning Navigation) for
mapless reinforcement learning-based robot navigation with learnable
representation of open-vocabulary 3D scene graph. To accelerate and stabilize
the training of reinforcement learning-based algorithms, the framework also
employs imitation learning and curriculum learning. The first one enables the
agent to learn from demonstrations, while the second one structures the
training process by gradually increasing task complexity from simple to more
advanced scenarios. Numerical experiments conducted in the Isaac Sim
environment showed that using a 3D scene graph for reinforcement learning
significantly increased the success rate in difficult navigation cases. The

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for calibrating a robot using olfactory and inertial data for centimeter-level odor source localization, demonstrating its effectiveness on a robotic arm in applications like robotic surgery and security screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in olfactory navigation tasks caused by gas dynamics and environmental factors by developing a calibration process for Olfactory Inertial Odometry (OIO).

Method: Defining a calibration process for OIO that works with various olfaction sensor types, focusing on achieving centimeter-level accuracy for odor source localization on a slow-moving robot.

Result: The proposed calibration improves OIO performance significantly compared to a cold-start olfactory navigation task when demonstrated on a real robotic arm.

Conclusion: A generalized calibration method for OIO has been developed, which enables centimeter-level odor source localization, showcasing potential uses in robotic surgery and touchless security screening.

Abstract: Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a process for fusing visual and kinematic
data to understand a machine's state in a navigation task. Olfactory inertial
odometry (OIO) is an analog to VIO that fuses signals from gas sensors with
inertial data to help a robot navigate by scent. Gas dynamics and environmental
factors introduce disturbances into olfactory navigation tasks that can make
OIO difficult to facilitate. With our work here, we define a process for
calibrating a robot for OIO that generalizes to several olfaction sensor types.
Our focus is specifically on calibrating OIO for centimeter-level accuracy in
localizing an odor source on a slow-moving robot platform to demonstrate use
cases in robotic surgery and touchless security screening. We demonstrate our
process for OIO calibration on a real robotic arm and show how this calibration
improves performance over a cold-start olfactory navigation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronoamperometry (CA) in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) suffers from long measurement durations due to high viscosity and slow mass transport.

Method: A novel mathematical regression approach that applies an inference algorithm to predict steady-state electrochemical parameters based on the initial transient current response.

Result: The method reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly faster than previous methods, and maintains reasonable accuracy without additional hardware modifications.

Conclusion: This technique enables faster multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements and has implications in analytical chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science.

Abstract: Chronoamperometry (CA) is a fundamental electrochemical technique used for
quantifying redox-active species. However, in room-temperature ionic liquids
(RTILs), the high viscosity and slow mass transport often lead to extended
measurement durations. This paper presents a novel mathematical regression
approach that reduces CA measurement windows to under 1 second, significantly
faster than previously reported methods, which typically require 1-4 seconds or
longer. By applying an inference algorithm to the initial transient current
response, this method accurately predicts steady-state electrochemical
parameters without requiring additional hardware modifications. The approach is
validated through comparison with standard chronoamperometric techniques and is
demonstrated to maintain reasonable accuracy while dramatically reducing data
acquisition time. The implications of this technique are explored in analytical
chemistry, sensor technology, and battery science, where rapid electrochemical
quantification is critical. Our technique is focused on enabling faster
multiplexing of chronoamperometric measurements for rapid olfactory and
electrochemical analysis.

TL;DR: A new AI-driven framework called cGSA is introduced to improve gene set analysis by adding context-aware pathway prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional GSA methods often produce long lists of enriched pathways with redundant or irrelevant results, requiring extensive manual effort to interpret.

Method: cGSA integrates gene cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify statistically and biologically meaningful pathways.

Result: Benchmarking showed cGSA outperforms baseline methods by over 30% in precision and interpretability.

Conclusion: The introduction of cGSA provides a more reliable and reproducible way to perform gene set analysis with context-specific insights.

Abstract: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a foundational approach for interpreting genomic
data of diseases by linking genes to biological processes. However,
conventional GSA methods overlook clinical context of the analyses, often
generating long lists of enriched pathways with redundant, nonspecific, or
irrelevant results. Interpreting these requires extensive, ad-hoc manual
effort, reducing both reliability and reproducibility. To address this
limitation, we introduce cGSA, a novel AI-driven framework that enhances GSA by
incorporating context-aware pathway prioritization. cGSA integrates gene
cluster detection, enrichment analysis, and large language models to identify
pathways that are not only statistically significant but also biologically
meaningful. Benchmarking on 102 manually curated gene sets across 19 diseases
and ten disease-related biological mechanisms shows that cGSA outperforms
baseline methods by over 30%, with expert validation confirming its increased
precision and interpretability. Two independent case studies in melanoma and
breast cancer further demonstrate its potential to uncover context-specific
insights and support targeted hypothesis generation.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: This paper introduces kTULA, a novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm designed for sampling from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. It provides a theoretical guarantee for its performance with a non-asymptotic convergence bound in KL divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to sample from distributions where the global Lipschitz continuity condition is often not satisfied, particularly in deep learning applications.

Method: Proposes a new algorithm called kTULA based on tamed Langevin dynamics.

Result: Establishes a non-asymptotic convergence bound in KL divergence with a significant improvement over previous results.

Conclusion: kTULA can be applied to high-dimensional double-well potential distribution sampling and neural network optimization problems, providing theoretical guarantees for its performance.

Abstract: Motivated by applications in deep learning, where the global Lipschitz
continuity condition is often not satisfied, we examine the problem of sampling
from distributions with super-linearly growing log-gradients. We propose a
novel tamed Langevin dynamics-based algorithm, called kTULA, to solve the
aforementioned sampling problem, and provide a theoretical guarantee for its
performance. More precisely, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence bound in
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with the best-known rate of convergence equal
to $2-\overline{\epsilon}$, $\overline{\epsilon}>0$, which significantly
improves relevant results in existing literature. This enables us to obtain an
improved non-asymptotic error bound in Wasserstein-2 distance, which can be
used to further derive a non-asymptotic guarantee for kTULA to solve the
associated optimization problems. To illustrate the applicability of kTULA, we
apply the proposed algorithm to the problem of sampling from a high-dimensional
double-well potential distribution and to an optimization problem involving a
neural network. We show that our main results can be used to provide
theoretical guarantees for the performance of kTULA.

Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.

Motivation: To address the issue of AI tools not being effectively used in medical practice due to their incompatibility with diagnostic reasoning and decision-making processes.

Conclusion: By shifting focus from benchmark performance to practical utility, this method could help bridge the translational gap in AI for medicine.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionise medicine, yet its impact
remains limited because of the pervasive translational gap. We posit that the
prevailing technology-centric approaches underpin this challenge, rendering
such systems fundamentally incompatible with clinical practice, specifically

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available Verilog code compared to software languages like Python.

Method: hdl2v translates or compiles VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 to Verilog.

Result: Performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model improved by up to 23% in VerilogEvalV2 and by 63% in a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach.

Conclusion: The presented hdl2v dataset increases the amount of human-written Verilog data, improving the performance of LLMs in Verilog generation tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing an increasingly large role in
domains such as code generation, including hardware code generation, where
Verilog is the key language. However, the amount of publicly available Verilog
code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages
like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which
seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by
translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL,
Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v
in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32
billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2,
without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger
models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data
augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and
analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of
HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better
performance.

Conclusion: Future work involves integrating all components and performing iterative design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Abstract: Processor chip design technology serves as a key frontier driving
breakthroughs in computer science and related fields. With the rapid
advancement of information technology, conventional design paradigms face three
major challenges: the physical constraints of fabrication technologies, the
escalating demands for design resources, and the increasing diversity of
ecosystems. Automated processor chip design has emerged as a transformative
solution to address these challenges. While recent breakthroughs in Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) techniques, have
opened new possibilities for fully automated processor chip design, substantial
challenges remain in establishing domain-specific LLMs for processor chip
design.
  In this paper, we propose QiMeng, a novel system for fully automated hardware
and software design of processor chips. QiMeng comprises three hierarchical
layers. In the bottom-layer, we construct a domain-specific Large Processor
Chip Model (LPCM) that introduces novel designs in architecture, training, and
inference, to address key challenges such as knowledge representation gap, data
scarcity, correctness assurance, and enormous solution space. In the
middle-layer, leveraging the LPCM's knowledge representation and inference
capabilities, we develop the Hardware Design Agent and the Software Design
Agent to automate the design of hardware and software for processor chips.
Currently, several components of QiMeng have been completed and successfully
applied in various top-layer applications, demonstrating significant advantages
and providing a feasible solution for efficient, fully automated
hardware/software design of processor chips. Future research will focus on
integrating all components and performing iterative top-down and bottom-up
design processes to establish a comprehensive QiMeng system.

Result: 展示了该方法在九个不同的最优控制问题上的准确性和一致性

Conclusion: 证明了简单神经算子架构与无约束优化结合可以有效解决多种最优控制问题

Abstract: Neural networks have been used to solve optimal control problems, typically
by training neural networks using a combined loss function that considers data,
differential equation residuals, and objective costs. We show that including
cost functions in the training process is unnecessary, advocating for a simpler
architecture and streamlined approach by decoupling the optimal control problem
from the training process. Thus, our work shows that a simple neural operator
architecture, such as DeepONet, coupled with an unconstrained optimization
routine, can solve multiple optimal control problems with a single
physics-informed training phase and a subsequent optimization phase. We achieve
this by adding a penalty term based on the differential equation residual to
the cost function and computing gradients with respect to the control using
automatic differentiation through the trained neural operator within an
iterative optimization routine. We showcase our method on nine distinct optimal
control problems by training three separate DeepONet models, each corresponding
to a different differential equation. For each model, we solve three problems
with varying cost functions, demonstrating accurate and consistent performance
across all cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To approximate the Pareto optimal set and the associated efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.

Method: Multiple Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))

Result: The variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test problems.

Conclusion: MOPBnB(so) can capture the Pareto optimal set and the estimations converge to the true objective function values.

Abstract: A multiple objective simulation optimization algorithm named Multiple
Objective Probabilistic Branch and Bound with Single Observation (MOPBnB(so))
is presented for approximating the Pareto optimal set and the associated
efficient frontier for stochastic multi-objective optimization problems.
MOPBnB(so) evaluates a noisy function exactly once at any solution and uses
neighboring solutions to estimate the objective functions, in contrast to a
variant that uses multiple replications at a solution to estimate the objective
functions. A finite-time performance analysis for deterministic multi-objective
problems provides a bound on the probability that MOPBnB(so) captures the
Pareto optimal set. Asymptotic convergence of MOPBnB(so) on stochastic problems
is derived, in that the algorithm captures the Pareto optimal set and the
estimations converge to the true objective function values. Numerical results
reveal that the variant with multiple replications is extremely intensive in
terms of computational resources compared to MOPBnB(so). In addition, numerical
results show that MOPBnB(so) outperforms a genetic algorithm NSGA-II on test
problems.

Motivation: 现有的导数方法如SINDy需要密集采样的数据且对噪声敏感，而我们的方法直接对矩轨迹建模，从而能够从稀疏和可能不规则的时间序列中进行稳健的学习。

Method: 使用基于神经常微分方程（ODE）的数据驱动框架来学习从PDE系统中得到的降阶矩动态，并且对于没有分析闭合的系统，引入了基于Stiefel流形优化的数据驱动坐标变换策略。

Result: 该框架在非线性薛定谔方程的应用平台上准确地恢复了当闭合可用时的矩动态方程，并且对于没有解析闭合的系统也能发现低维表示使得矩动态闭合。此外，在没有已知闭合模型的情况下，如Fisher-KPP反应扩散系统，神经ODE仍然可以有效地逼近未闭合的矩动态并实现优于物理专家衍生ODE模型的外推精度。

Conclusion: Neural ODE框架被证明是一个强大而灵活的工具，用于学习复杂PDE系统中的可解释、低维矩动态。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework for learning reduced-order moment dynamics
from PDE-governed systems using Neural ODEs. In contrast to derivative-based
methods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to
noise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,
enabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.
Using as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the
framework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is
available, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without
analytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation
strategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of
low-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,
facilitating interpretable and reliable modeling. We also explore cases where a
closure model is not known, such as a Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion system.
Here we demonstrate that Neural ODEs can still effectively approximate the
unclosed moment dynamics and achieve superior extrapolation accuracy compared
to physical-expert-derived ODE models. This advantage remains robust even under
sparse and irregular sampling, highlighting the method's robustness in
data-limited settings. Our results highlight the Neural ODE framework as a
powerful and flexible tool for learning interpretable, low-dimensional moment
dynamics in complex PDE-governed systems.
