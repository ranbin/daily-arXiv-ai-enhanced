Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

To this end, we leverage the\ndifferentiability of the composite loss formulation which is widely used for\noptimizing multiple empirical losses simultaneously and model it as a novel\nlayer which is parameterized with a softmax operation that satisfies the\ninherent positivity constraints on loss hyperparameters while avoiding\ndegenerate empirical gradients. We complete our joint end-to-end optimization\nscheme by defining a novel regularization loss on the learned hyperparameters,\nwhich models a uniformity prior among the employed losses while ensuring\nboundedness of the identified optima. We evidence the efficacy of YOTO in\njointly optimizing loss hyperparameters and regular model parameters in one\nshot by comparing it to the commonly used brute-force grid search across\nstate-of-the-art networks solving two key problems in computer vision, i.e. 3D\nestimation and semantic segmentation, and showing that it consistently\noutperforms the best grid-search model on unseen test data.

This late-stage collapse is distinct, from the known\npre-grokking and grokking phases, and is not detected by other proposed\ngrokking progress measures. Leveraging Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization HTSR\nthrough the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we show that the HTSR layer quality\nmetric $\\alpha$ alone delineates all three phases, whereas the best competing\nmetrics detect only the first two. The \\emph{anti-grokking} is revealed by\ntraining for $10^7$ and is invariably heralded by $\\alpha < 2$ and the\nappearance of \\emph{Correlation Traps} -- outlier singular values in the\nrandomized layer weight matrices that make the layer weight matrix atypical and\nsignal overfitting of the training set. Such traps are verified by visual\ninspection of the layer-wise empirical spectral densities, and by using\nKolmogorov--Smirnov tests on randomized spectra.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions.

The core idea is that if\nthe DL model generates comments that are semantically similar to the expected\nones or can be successfully implemented by a second model specialized in code\nrefinement, these comments are likely to be meaningful and useful, thus\ndeserving a high reward in the reinforcement learning framework.

In contrast to derivative-based\nmethods like SINDy, which necessitate densely sampled data and are sensitive to\nnoise, our approach based on Neural ODEs directly models moment trajectories,\nenabling robust learning from sparse and potentially irregular time series.\nUsing as an application platform the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, the\nframework accurately recovers governing moment dynamics when closure is\navailable, even with limited and irregular observations. For systems without\nanalytical closure, we introduce a data-driven coordinate transformation\nstrategy based on Stiefel manifold optimization, enabling the discovery of\nlow-dimensional representations in which the moment dynamics become closed,\nfacilitating interpretable and reliable modeling.

To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid\narchitecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention\nmodule with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and\ncausal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to\nnew sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We\nevaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical\ndecoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical\napplications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects.\nNotably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings\nimproves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the\nexciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find\nthat POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nTransformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU).\nThese results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the\ngap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural\ndecoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784POSSM\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdbTransformer\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784POSSM\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u8109\u51b2\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b(SSM)\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u56e0\u679c\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "POSSM\u5728\u6052\u6cb3\u7334\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u76ae\u8d28\u5185\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u5199\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u89e3\u7801\uff09\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6052\u6cb3\u7334\u8fd0\u52a8\u76ae\u5c42\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u5199\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6df7\u5408SSM\u662f\u5f25\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u95ed\u73af\u5e94\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u65f6\u3002"}}
